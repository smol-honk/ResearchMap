Adolescent Apprentices in Germany,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1994-08-01,Alice Schlegel,1997-01-31,Alice Schlegel,"Schlegel 9318995 This projects supports the Research of a cultural anthropologist from the University of Arizona. the project tests a hypothesis of adolescent behavior: that adolescents who spend more time with adults differ in measurable ways (display less aggressiveness, competitiveness, and anti-social behavior) from those who spend more time with peers. The project will study adolescent apprentices in Germany, a country with a well-developed system of apprenticeship. A sample of industrial apprentices will be compared with a matched sample of school attenders in relations with family, peers and unrelated adults for various aspects of adolescent behavior. The subjects will be observed in their natural settings, the classroom and workplace. Questionnaires and tests to measure their relationships and attitudes will be administered. This research is important because adolescent violence is a major problem in contemporary society, and increases in our understanding of its causes will help us control it. In addition the project is timely since the German in American. This study should help us assess its applicability for our nation. ! ! !

"Doctoral Dissertation: Pregnancy and Diabetes in Pima Women: Ideas of Risk, Treatment Efficiacy and Diabetes Prevention In and After Pregnancy",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2000-04-01,Ana Ortiz,2002-03-31,Ana Ortiz,"This project will investigate high rates of diabetes among the Pima, a group of Native Americans living on the Gila River reservation. The researcher will focus on why the Pima participate in or reject biomedical treatment and prevention, and how they seek to combine biomedicine with their own desires for self-determination and cultural identity. As the incidence of diabetes is on the rise in this population, biomedical treatment participation and completion continue to be poor. The research will document Native American health seeking behaviors and illness interpretation in a context of pluralistic therapy systems, as well as in terms of their specific social and political economic situation in American society. The research will focus specifically on Pima women (mothers and pregnant women); of women over age 35, approximately half have diabetes."
IPG: Collaborative Research: A high-resolution analysis of unique paleoenvironmental data from key hominin sites in East Africa,Biological Anthropology,2012-10-01,Andrew Cohen,2016-03-31,"Owen Davis, Rene Bobe, Jeffery Stone","The possibility that human evolution in Africa has been strongly influenced by Earth's climatic and environmental history over the last several million years has been an important question at the forefront of paleoanthropological research. One fundamental question is: can any of the potential envionmental drivers of evolutionary change be reconstructed with enough precision to allow us to relate them with confidence to the episodes of speciation, extinction and cultural evolution known to anthropologists, and thereby test their relationships in time and space?<br/><br/>This team of paleoanthropologists and earth scientists plans to analyze climate and other environmental histories to provide direct tests of key hypotheses linking environmental history and mammal (including early human) evolution by collecting and analyzing detailed paleoenvironmental data at three key anthropological sites in Africa. They will collect continuous paleoenvironmental records by drilling long sediment cores from ancient lake beds in the northern Afar, Ethiopia (~3.8-2.9 million years ago-Ma), the Baringo Basin, Kenya (~3.2-2.35 Ma), and the Turkana Basin, Kenya (~2.3-1.42 Ma), and relate these records to the outcrops in the same basins that contain early human and other mammal fossils, as well as stone tools in the younger time periods. As a group these basins contain some of the most critical evidence for human evolutionary history in Africa. Although past investigators have reconstructed climate and other environmental histories from the outcrops in which the fossil humans and artifacts have been found, such environmental records are highly discontinuous due to the nature of the sediments where the fossils occur, and are unsuitable for many of the most informative geochemical records available today because of the weathering that has affected outcropping sediments. Drilling lakebeds near the fossil sites gets around these problems, because lake sediments accumulate much more continuously, and because drilling into the subsurface allows unweathered samples to be collected Funding for the drilling costs for this project has been secured from other sources: with the IPG funds the team will analyze the cores to generate quantitative and high resolution records of changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, fire and volcanic activity and other factors which may have influenced human evolution.<br/><br/>The primary research goal is to obtain long cores from these basins, each of which span critical intervals in human evolution and are close to hominin fossil and archaeological sites. The researchers will apply state-of-the-art paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate methods to these cores to assemble high resolution records covering much of the past four million years of East African environmental history. The team will then evaluate existing hypotheses and generate new hypotheses linking climate history to early human physical and cultural evolutionary adaptations. The paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data collected from the drill cores will be linked directly in time and space to the nearby fossil human, mammal and stone tool records by way of the numerous volcanic ashes present in both the cores and outcrops, along with other dating techniques. By comparing the new records to similar records from nearby ocean sediment cores the researchers plan be able to distinguish local from global drivers of environmental change and in the process test a series of hypotheses linking key events in human evolution with climate and other aspects of environmental history. Finally, the team will use these new, combined paleoenvironmental and paleoanthropological data sets, combined with novel modeling techniques to better understand how landscape and climate change across various scales of time and space may have affected the availability and predictability of critical ecosystem resources upon which early humans would have depended. <br/><br/>This project will greatly expand our understanding of African climate history and will be an opportunity to invigorate interest in human evolution and its relationship to climate with the US and African public. The project will train many American and African students during its field, analytical and internship/synthesis phases, and will generate numerous informal science learning opportunities through our collaborations with the National Museums of Kenya and Ethiopia and the Smithsonian Institution."
SGER: Scientific Drilling for Human Origins: Exploring the Application of Drill Core Records to Understanding Hominin Evolution,"ARCHAEOLOGY, Biological Anthropology, GLOBAL CHANGE, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH, SEDIMENTARY GEO & PALEOBIOLOGY",2007-08-01,Andrew Cohen,2010-01-31,"Roy Johnson, Craig Feibel","PIs propose to investigate how continental scientific drilling can be used as a tool in understanding the environmental background of human origins. This new research direction in merging earth science and paleoanthropology will involve obtaining sediment drill core samples from lake beds located on-land, close to areas of critical importance for understanding human evolution. Their efforts will be focused around critical time intervals for human origins during the last 3.5 million years. In this first phase of research, they will obtain critical site-survey and subsurface data for four key localities in Kenya and Ethiopia, essential to the success of a future drilling program, to be funded by a later proposal. They also request partial funding for a drilling workshop, to consider the technical and scientific opportunities and challenges posed by each of the sites under consideration.<br/><br/>Prior researchers have asked the key question of why evolution of humans and their close relatives displays a pulsed pattern, with well-defined periods of extensive speciation or extinction, cultural change and geographic expansion, interspersed with long periods when relatively little change seems to occur. Is this the result of broad forcing effects of either directional environmental change (climate, etc.), the result of changes in the variability of local or regional environments, or some yet-unrecognized mechanism. These efforts have proceeded either by correlating broad-scale patterns of human evolutionary patterns with the global beat of climate variability as recorded in the continuous records of deep-sea sediment cores or, by correlating regional shifts in the fossil and archaeological record with more local patterns of environmental change, inferred from outcrop records of ancient soils, lake beds and non-hominin fossils. PIs argue for a new research direction linking the earth science and anthropology communities in addressing this central question about human origins, combining the strengths of both of the approaches above, and avoiding some of their inherent weaknesses. Their plan promotes a concerted effort to obtain drill core records from near-continuous sedimentary sequences located close to areas of critical importance for understanding hominin evolution, focused around critical time intervals for their key question above. Drill cores will provide a record that will vastly improve understanding of environmental history in the places and times where various species of our near-relatives lived. Obtaining such records from on land will provide a more detailed and resolved record than what we can currently infer from deep sea core records. Finally, because the largest number of critical events in man's evolutionary history occurred in Africa, such a drilling campaign should start in that continent. <br/><br/>Few scientific questions can be more central to humanity than understanding where we have come from as a species, and how our environment has shaped our biological and technological evolution. Results from this proposal will pave the way for a new direction for helping researchers address these questions and will foster a new avenue for earth science/anthropology collaborations. <br/><br/>This international drilling program has important science training opportunities for involving early-career American and African scientists in all aspects of the project. Several students will be involved in the seismic site survey exercises leading up to the workshop, and some students who are likely to join the program in post-graduate work would be able to attend the workshop. This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering."
"Excavations at the Middle Paleoithic Site of La Quina (Charente), France",ARCHAEOLOGY,1991-02-01,Arthur Jelinek,1995-01-31,Arthur Jelinek,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Arthur Jelinek will conduct three seasons of archaeological research at the site of La Quina which is located in the Charente region of France. This important Mousterian site has been the focus of this group for several years and the results to date well justify continued excavation. The site itself contains a series of stratified deposits which are extremely rich in both faunal and cultural remains. Human skeletal material has also been recovered. To date, approximately 6,000 lithic objects and 11,000 bones have been catalogued. Over the next three field seasons, the team will expand the excavations in all levels. Several approaches will be attempted to provide absolute dates for each level and archaeological materials will be analyzed to shed insight into Mousterian cultural and subsistence practices. Mousterian culture dates from the most recent part of the Pleistocene (Ice Age) and is associated with Neanderthal peoples who were the immediate predecessors to modern humans. In recent years, these Neanderthals have been the subject of intense archaeological debate. Some have argued that this group acted in ways significantly different from the succeeding Upper Paleolithic groups and lacked the capacity for modern culture. Others argue that Mousterian industries and the behaviors they reflect are quite complex. Unfortunately, little well collected data exists to permit examination of the issue and in this context the site of La Quina is particularly important because of the rich cultural materials it contains. The large faunal assemblage should permit reconstruction of Mousterian hunting techniques and demonstrate how these changed and developed over time. This research is important for several reasons. It will yield data of interest to a large group of archaeologists. It will provide insight into the background from which physically modern humans emerged and shed light on the process which led to this development. Because Dr. Jelinek includes many students in this project, it should aid in the scientific recruitment."
"The Economic, Social, and Political Reorganization of Late Prehistoric Pueblo Communities in the Silver Creek Area, Arizona",ARCHAEOLOGY,1995-08-01,Barbara Mills,1998-01-31,Barbara Mills,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Mills and her colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research at sites located in the Silver Creek region of Arizona. Archaeologists believe that this area marks the location of significant and far-reaching changes during the late prehistoric period in the American Southwest. There is strong evidence from settlement pattern data to support the idea that large groups of peoples moved into the region between 1000 and 1400 AD. The region therefore has the potential to shed light on the causes and consequences of population reorganization, including the processes of migration, aggregation, integration and dispersion. Relatively little archaeological research however has been conducted, and Dr. Mills' work will remedy this situation. Over the course of two field seasons she will excavate three sites representing different time periods between the 11th and 14th centuries. She will collect ceramic and tree ring samples to refine chronology. She will examine demographic trends and note changes in social and economic organization. She will also compare and synthesize cultural and paleoenvironmental data. The membership of small-scale agricultural societies throughout the world is often fluid as individuals, households, groups of households and even whole communities change residences. These moves vary in their causes, the distances moved, their permanence and ultimately in their effects. In some cases new residential sites are colonized through village fissioning and connections are maintained with the original villages through extension of existing social networks. In other cases, portions of the population are incorporated into preexisting communities and social, political and religious institutions established or extended to integrate the host and migrant populations. In both cases, changes in integrative mechanisms may ensue. Understanding changes in community organization, especially those processes relating to community integration is a key to understanding wider economic, social and political changes. Dr. Mills Silver Creek study provides an excellent opportunity to study these processes over an extended period of time. This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the prehistory of the United States and provide data of interest to many archaeologists. Given the fluidity of populations in today's world, the work will increase our understanding of how new social entities emerge and are maintained."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement: In the Aftermath of Migration- Modeling the Social Consequences of Classic Period Migrations in Southeastern Arizona,ARCHAEOLOGY,2003-11-15,Barbara Mills,2005-10-31,Barbara Mills,"Under the supervision of Dr. Barbara J. Mills, Anna Neuzil will undertake research to understand the scale and impact of Classic period (A.D. 1200-1450) migrations into southeastern Arizona. She will focus on the Safford Basin and Aravaipa Creek areas, which have been relatively unstudied by southwestern archaeologists. Yet, many scholars have speculated that these areas experienced an influx of migrants from the north during the Classic Period. Neuzil's research will look at prehistoric ceramics, domestic architecture, and the structure of space on the surface of 30 sites to determine 1) the scale at which prehistoric migration into these regions occurred, and 2) the effect of migration on the expression of identity by both migrant and indigenous populations.<br/><br/>Research on migration in the archaeological record has advanced considerably in the last decade, and Neuzil's project will take the understanding of migration an important step further. Migration is known to have played an important role in many regions of the Southwest, but very little of this research has addressed the ways in which people with widely disparate cultural backgrounds dealt with each other following migration. Neuzil's research will focus on four main types of evidence to identify and establish the extent of migrants in the archaeological record, and understand how the identity of migrants and indigenous populations changed following migration. Unpainted ceramics and domestic architecture will be examined for evidence of differences in their manufacturing techniques, which have been demonstrated to differentiate between populations with distinct backgrounds, such as migrant and indigenous populations. Similarly, the arrangement of space at the sites examined will be analyzed to investigate differences between migrant and host populations. Previous spatial analyses have shown that space can be quantified and interpreted to reflect the unique backgrounds of people and groups. Decorated ceramics will be used to place sites in a temporal framework, and examine how individuals and groups expressed their identity in the stylistic designs of these vessels. With these four types of evidence, Neuzil will not only advance the understanding of this poorly studied area, but also contribute to migration research with a potentially broad interdisciplinary impact.<br/><br/>This research will have two main areas of impact beyond its contribution to the archaeological understanding of the Safford and Aravaipa areas and migration processes. First, the results of this research will be presented to Native American tribes who have an interest in the area. Although this research is not intended to demonstrate cultural affiliation between the groups that inhabited this area in the past and any specific tribe, the results of this research will be of interest to Native American tribes as they establish an understanding of the overall demographics and population dynamics of the Southwest from an archaeological perspective. Second, public outreach, particularly in terms of the dissemination of this research to the local Safford and Aravaipa communities, is an important aspect of this project. Neuzil will engage in public presentations and consultation on the development of exhibits at local museums, and disseminate publications written for the public throughout the course of this project. Furthermore, Neuzil will gain training in field and analysis methods important to her development as an archaeological scholar."
Dissertation Research: Community Organization on the Chacoan Frontier,ARCHAEOLOGY,1996-07-01,Barbara Mills,1998-06-30,Barbara Mills,"Under the direction of Dr. Barbara Mills, MS Sarah Herr will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct archaeological research in the Mogollon rim area of Arizona and supplement this with the analysis of museum collections. Her focus will be on the period between the 10th through 12th centuries AD. Kivas are large, usually well constructed partially underground structures with wooden roofs and were used for religions purposes. Because they serve as a central focus for a community, by determining a kiva's size, care expended on its construction and its internal organization it is possible to gain insight into the structure of the community which built it. MS Herr, will coordinate her work with the University of Arizona field school and excavate the kiva at the Hough's Great Kiva site. She will study the ceramics and other materials collected and augment these data with analyzes of materials from other Mogollon rim sites. On this basis she will reconstruct the social organization of the region and compare it to that in neighboring areas. The Southwest has long served as a focus for archaeological attention because of the imposing ruins present and the roads which linked many of them. Clearly prehistoric people achieved a significant degree of social complexity in a harsh desert environment. Most researchers have concentrated their efforts on the largest sites and the areas which contain them and relatively work has been done in what appear to be underpopulated regions. Thus little is known about how communities in these latter areas functioned and how they were integrated (or not integrated) into more `central` areas. The Mogollon Rim has traditionally been viewed by archaeologists as a peripheral area and it forms the focus of MS Herr's study. She has proposed an original perspective - frontier theory - from which to view this area and to examine its relationships with more `central` regions. This work will provide the data to test her idea. This research is important for several regions. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and shed new light on the American past. It will serve to develop the application of a very powerful theoretical approach and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
"Ceramics, Colonialism, and Household Practice at Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, A.D. 1300-1900",ARCHAEOLOGY,2002-06-01,Barbara Mills,2005-05-31,Barbara Mills,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Mills and her colleagues will conduct one year of laboratory analyses to investigate the effects of European colonization at Zuni Pueblo. Zuni was the first Pueblo area reached during the Spanish entradas of the 16th century and is an excellent example of a Native American community lying on the frontier of colonialism. Like other Pueblo areas, population decline, settlement coalescence, religious repression, economic oppression, and the adoption of new foods and technologies all took place at Zuni while under Spanish, Mexican, and American governance. Although the Zuni area has enormous potential for looking at the processes of colonialism from an archaeological perspective, past work was conducted prior to modern systematic methods of excavations and analysis. A recent excavation project conducted by the Pueblo of Zuni has resulted in the first systematic collection of materials from one of the contact period Zuni Pueblos - Zuni Pueblo itself. Zuni Pueblo (Halona:wa) has been continuously occupied since the late 13th century and it provides a unique context to investigate the processes of colonialism in a Native American community. This project will support analyses of the large collection of ceramics, supplemental funding for botanical analyses, and travel for the faunal and botanical analysts to come to Arizona to participate in an advanced seminar on the project. Dr. Mills's research will include the analysis of ceramic assemblages from over six centuries of occupation at Zuni Pueblo, focusing on the following research objectives: (1) establishing a baseline chronology for the project; (2) investigating the timing and rate of change in Zuni diet and cuisine; (3) evaluating the impact of colonialism on the organization of household labor; and (4) exploring how Zuni identity was constructed and maintained through material culture. Intensive ceramic analyses will be conducted over one year, including analyses of production technology, changes in vessel forms, chemical analyses of food residues, and design analyses. The ceramic data will be compared to the results of pollen, macrobotanical, and faunal analyses for a comprehensive analysis of how diet and food preparation changed through time. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide the Zuni people with information about their past that is only accessible through archaeological research. It will also provide important insights into how cultures in contact interact, including changes in diet and cuisine, labor, and identity."
"Dissertation Research: Household Ritual, Ceramic Figurines, and Gender in the Hohokam Regional System",ARCHAEOLOGY,2002-02-15,Barbara Mills,2004-01-31,Barbara Mills,"Under the direction of Dr. Barbara Mills, Ms. Susan Stinson will collect data for her doctoral dissertation on the Hohokam archaeological region of the Greater Southwest USA. Her research addresses ritual within prehistoric households by determining the function and subsequent discard practices for ceramic figurines. These small figurines were used in Hohokam houses from 300 BC to AD 700 and they often were placed in household trash when discarded. Approximately 1300 figurines in museum collections will be analyzed as part of this project, and most of these were recovered from the two large sites of Snaketown and Grewe in southern Arizona. Hohokam researchers have previously assumed that these figurines were used in community-wide ceremonial activities associated with ballcourts that are similar to those in Mesoamerica. Ms. Stinson will determine whether the figurines were instead part of domestic ritual by testing three different hypotheses for their use: (1) they were used in healing and curing ritual, (2) they were used in ritual designed to promote a connection to deceased relatives (ancestors), or (3) they were used as children's toys. In order to determine figurine function, patterns of construction material, form, wear or damage, and the location and manner of disposal will be analyzed. <br/><br/>In addition to these analyses, Ms. Stinson will determine who the producers of these figurines were by examining fingerprint impressions left on the wet clay surface of the figures before they were fired. These fingerprint analyses provide a direct link between the manufacture of figurines and gendered roles within the household. Ridge counting will be used to distinguish between children and adults, and males and females. A ridge count is an objective, quantitative measure of the size of the fingerprint pattern, and it is recorded by counting the number of friction ridges within a certain specified area. Ms. Stinson has already tested this technique on both archaeological ceramics and a set of modern prints from an extended family in the Philippines. This fingerprint technique is new to archaeological research and has the potential to revolutionize how gender roles are assigned in prehistory. This project also contributes to research on households, figurines, and ritual and gender in the household. It tests hypotheses about figurine function in an archaeological region of the American Southwest that have been assumed, but never scientifically tested. The project also assists in training a promising young scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Unpacking Personhood and Identity in the Hohokam Area of Southern Arizona,ARCHAEOLOGY,2011-06-15,Barbara Mills,2013-05-31,Jessica Cerezo-Roman,"Under the supervision of Dr. Barbara J. Mills, Jessica I. Cerezo-Romˆn will analyze mortuary practices among the Southern Arizona Hohokam during the Preclassic (A.D. 700-1150) and Classic periods (A.D. 1150-1450/1500) to look at how identities were defined by the participation of individuals in different social networks. They will use the concept of personhood to elucidate how individuals' networks were defined through burial practices, spatial distributions, and associated material culture. Prior research in the U.S. Southwest typically focused on single attributes of identity, such as social status and gender. However in the past decade archaeological approaches to identity have broadened considerably and have gone beyond single attributes of identity to look at the multiple ways in which identity was constructed. The proposed research will focus on evidence from 12 archaeological sites in the Tucson area. <br/><br/>The proposed research will build on significant advances in identity studies of past populations, particularly by looking beyond the study of a single attribute of identity to the multiple ways a person's identity was constructed. It will employ an original approach that has implications for refinement of archaeological method and theory. <br/><br/>The project will examine three problems related to the identification of, and changes in, aspects of identity and personhood:<br/><br/>1. What is the range of identity practices found within a site's mortuary assemblage, and how do these intersect to reveal different aspects of identity associated with the individual's age, sex, and group identity, among others?<br/>2. What are the differences and similarities between sites, and why do they or don't they occur?<br/>3. What are the differences/similarities through time at different scales, and why do they or don't they occur?<br/><br/>To answer these questions a multidimensional approach will be used that incorporates several spatial scales through time, and that applies different statistical analyses. The approach used will analyze how people were represented in mortuary rituals by analyzing human skeletal remains from the sites, how people in the past treated those bodies, and the archaeological contexts of burial. The combination of the study of the skeletal remains, posthumous treatment of the body and archaeological context will reveal clues to how people were remembered at death by their families and community, and an individual's position(s) within multiple social networks. <br/><br/>Beyond research questions that are important to social scientist the research will provide information on prehistoric populations that may support links to contemporary indigenous groups. The data generated through this research can be used by tribes and institutions for cultural affiliation studies. Upon completion the results of the research will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community, Native American communities, and to the general public."
Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant: Religion at the Edges: Social Boundaries and Religious Architecture in the Prehispanic Southwest,ARCHAEOLOGY,2013-05-15,Barbara Mills,2015-04-30,Katherine Dungan,"Under the supervision of Dr. Barbara Mills, Katherine Dungan will analyze prehispanic religious architecture dating to the 13th and 14th centuries C.E. in east-central Arizona and west-central New Mexico. This large region contains multiple spatial and social boundary zones, areas where groups practicing distinct cultural traditions lived in close proximity to one another. The study will examine the relationship of religious architecture to these boundary zones, asking whether religion played a role in the creation and reinforcement of social boundaries, or, alternatively, whether religion was more flexible at social boundaries. The study will approach these questions through the examination of spatial variability in great kiva (religious structure) characteristics. If great kivas in social boundary zones adhere to an ideal form or size this would suggest that they facilitated boundary maintenance. Conversely, greater variability among boundary zone structures would suggest that a boundary position contributed to religious experimentation or flexibility. Research on religion in the context of boundaries over time challenges the long-standing view of religion in premodern or small-scale societies as primarily integrative.<br/><br/>The research will include revisiting collections and records from previously excavated great kivas, along with the creation of a large-scale database from published and unpublished records of approximately 100 sites. Most of the collections to be reexamined were excavated in the mid-20th century, with only the most unusual or spectacular finds interpreted as evidence of religious activity. Reevaluation of these collections, housed primarily at the Field Museum, Harvard Peabody Museum, and Museum of New Mexico Laboratory of Anthropology, should contribute substantially to the broader study of Southwestern religion. The use of existing collections adheres to a preservation-focused approach to archaeology, which emphasizes research with a minimal impact on the archaeological record. The Upper Gila area of New Mexico will serve as an intensive local study area, with data from recently completed excavations and intensive collections analysis complementing the regional database. Limited excavation at a 13th-century site in Mule Creek, NM has demonstrated that this area served as a social boundary zone through time and that the site's religious architecture is unusual compared to that of the larger region. <br/><br/>Beyond these specific questions, the research aims to make broader contributions. The database, with spatial data removed, will be made available online, substantially increasing the accessibility of data from understudied collections. Public lands make up a large portion of the study area; the study will increase the information available to managing agencies and for public interpretation. The analysis of material from the completed excavations will continue to provide training opportunities for undergraduates at multiple institutions, including the University of Arizona and Pima Community College. The research continues the collaboration between the University of Arizona and Archaeology Southwest, a non-profit organization focused on archaeological preservation and research. The results of the work will be presented to the public through Archaeology Southwest's website, magazine, and public presentations in Tucson and the Upper Gila, and to an academic audience through peer-reviewed publications. Finally, the results will be used in Archaeology Southwest's landowner outreach in the Upper Gila, ultimately contributing to the preservation of the archaeological record."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Examining Social Networks And Communties Of Resistance To New Religious Movements,DDRI Archaeology,2015-07-01,Barbara Mills,2016-03-31,Lewis Borck,"Dr. Barbara Mills (University of Arizona) and Lewis Borck (University of Arizona and Archaeology Southwest) will examine the complex ways that people react to changing cultural and organizational patterns brought about by the spread, or diffusion, of a new religious ideology. The researchers will study how objects of daily and ceremonial life shaped the complicated social and political lives of past groups of people. Understanding how people in the past reacted to an expansive ideology provides comparative data to evaluate against modern expansive religions, including their various sects. This will improve understanding not only of how ideology spreads, but also of how and why groups join or resist a new religion. Previous archaeological research on diffusion has focused on technology rather than ideas or ideology, and such investigations typically relied on either spatial data or social data. This project will integrate social network and spatial diffusion models to demonstrate to researchers in many fields the utility and accuracy of integrating the two approaches. This project will also share information about archaeological ethics, ownership of the past, and deep local history with community members (landowners, community college students, and public school students) in areas often underserved by academia.<br/><br/>Dr. Mills and Mr. Borck will use archaeological data from across all of Arizona and western New Mexico to examine how people in the late prehispanic Southwest reacted to changes associated with the spread of the Salado religious cult during the thirteenth through fifteenth centuries (A.D. 1200-1450). This project will measure the probable level of exposure to and the corresponding level (or lack) of resistance to the spread of Salado by modeling resistance using ceramic distribution data (where certain kinds of pottery were made and used, and then found by archaeologists). They will compare these data against a null model that includes a spatial component that models the flow of material goods, as well as a social network component that examines how ideas spread through a network over time. Archaeology as a field is particularly useful for examining difficult, long-term processes such as the spread of religion, because archaeological data primarily derive from material objects, rather than textual or ethnographic records that may incorporate human bias. This research will generate new methods for studying the spread of ideas across time and space, and these methods will be useful to diverse researchers examining similar processes in the past and the present."
Ceramic Production and the Economic Organization of Protohistoric Zuni Society,ARCHAEOLOGY,1991-07-15,Barbara Mills,1993-06-30,Barbara Mills,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Mills will conduct an analysis of two Zuni pottery samples. One derives from complete vessels collected from living individuals in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The other comes from archaeological materials excavated from known Zuni sites which were occupied from the 15th to 17th centuries A.D. The goal of the study is to use the ethnographic samples as a control and on this basis, reconstruct both pottery making and social organization during the earlier period. Dr. Mills will focus on both shape and size of vessels as well as the raw materials from which they are constructed. In particular, she is concerned with degrees of standardization since this can be taken as an indirect measure of social organization. She will analyze raw material through use of Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, Inductively-Coupled Plasma Emission Spectroscopy and electron microprobe analysis. The degree of standardization in raw material preparation will be determined through visual imaging techniques. Careful ethnographic studies in the United States began in the late 1800's and much first hand data are available for groups like the Zuni from that period. However, it is uncertain how stable native American social organization is over time, given increasing influence of European contact. For anthropologists, this poses a major problem since 19th and 20th century models are usually (and with doubtful validity) extended back in time. Dr. Mills postulates that organization of ceramic manufacture reflects societal organization: especially degree of authority centralization. Through analysis of well controlled ethnographic and archaeological pottery samples, she will be able to examine social change through time. This research is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of native American history and prehistory. It will also serve to develop techniques which will be of anthropological use in many parts of the world."
Collaborative Research: Exploring Adaptive Social Networks in the Face of Geographic Adversity,ARCHAEOLOGY,2014-03-01,Barbara Mills,2017-02-28,Barbara Mills,"The fundamental goal of this research is an understanding of how traditional groups maintain and adapt social ties over time and across large geographic areas in spite of their low population density and changing natural environment. The research is focused in the United States Southwest where significant long-term environmental changes set the scene for observing societal network changes over time. Improved understanding of how historic societies adapted provides insight into how modern-day traditional societies might adapt and maintain their own social networks. <br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Mills and Dr. Jeffery Clark will collaborate with a team of researchers to look at the dynamics of social and spatial networks in the archaeology of the Chaco region of the U.S. Southwest. The research team will combine social network analysis and geographic information systems to analyze ceramic, lithic, and architectural data in the Chaco region. Chaco Canyon World Heritage Site is at the spatial center of what has been called the ""Chaco World"" during the 10th to early 12th centuries, and contains a concentration of architectural features known as great houses and great kivas. How it came to prominence and the social relationship of the central canyon to contemporaneous communities are enduring archaeological questions of broad interest. <br/><br/>The research builds on a considerable amount of past research in the Chaco region by compiling a new dataset integrating architectural and material culture data from within and outside Chaco Canyon. The database will add to the Chaco World database at the Chaco Research Archive and ceramic and lithic data for the post-A.D. 1200 period from the Southwest Social Networks Project. New ceramic analyses of existing collections and obsidian provenance analyses will augment data from published and unpublished reports. These data will be used to address the following questions: (1) How were Chaco great houses related to each other? (2) Were Pueblo Bonito and other Chaco Canyon great houses socially central in the regional network? (3) How did trajectories of great house and great kiva social networks change over time? And (4) how did great houses and great kivas relate to their surrounding communities of small houses? Recent research has suggested the need to analyze data from throughout the region, without assuming it was an integrated system, to better understand the ways in which great house communities were connected to each other and the central canyon. The research has the potential to resolve several questions currently being raised in many archaeological regions, not just Chaco. These include the relationship of hierarchy and centrality, and the role of specific historical processes such as migration, social diversification, and inequality in non-state societies. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include: (1) collaboration with the Chaco Research Archive to provide updates to the Chaco World Database; (2) creation of a new database that integrates artifact data on great houses, great kivas, and selected outlier communities; (3) public talks to interested audiences throughout the region; (4) a special issue of the magazine, Archaeology Southwest, which is widely used for public outreach and in classrooms; (5) a series of journal articles; and (6) training of graduate students in the application of social network analysis to archaeological datasets."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: The Protohistoric Tewa World: Coalescence and Identity in the Northern Rio Grande Region, New Mexico",ARCHAEOLOGY,2007-12-01,Barbara Mills,2009-11-30,Barbara Mills,"Samuel Duwe, under the supervision of Dr. Barbara Mills, will examine the ways in which group identity was created and transformed among ancestral Pueblo communities during population coalescence, or the process of regional populations nucleating at larger but fewer sites. More specifically, this research will focus on the Classic Period (A.D. 1325-1600) Tewa villages of northern New Mexico. Over an approximately 250-year period forty large villages underwent population coalescence. By the time of Spanish colonization in A.D. 1598, only six Tewa villages remained occupied. Although the causes of this residential restructuring have been the focus of a century of research, few studies have examined the social effects on the movers themselves. Investigating group identity, or the ways in which individuals and collectives are distinguished from other individuals and collectives, allows for a clearer understanding of how human social networks were organized in prehistory. Using group identity as a proxy for social change, this research attempts to understand how Tewa villagers adapted their social systems during a period of dramatic upheaval, and how coalescence contributed to the formation of the historic Tewa identity encountered by the Spanish colonists and Anglo explorers and anthropologists. <br/><br/>This research will measure changes in ancestral Tewa group identity during coalescence in three dimensions: where and when people were moving across the landscape, ceramic exchange relationships within and outside the region, and changes in the elaboration and use of ritual spaces. Focusing primarily on 11 large pueblos, Duwe will map sites, surface collect artifacts, analyze pottery from surface collected and museum collections, and conduct chemical compositional analyses. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposed research is three fold: regional, archaeological, and anthropological. This project will make substantial regional contributions to the archaeology of the Northern Rio Grande and the Greater Southwest. The research will provide chronological and spatial data for both residential and ritual features, as well as the first large-scale chemical analyses of clay and ceramics for the Tewa pueblos. The methodologies used in this research will be important for other archaeologists working in the Greater Southwest and in prehistoric societies worldwide who study similar processes of population coalescence and residential reorganization. The model used in this study will further archaeological discourse in using theoretical programs such as identity and coalescence by presenting an increasingly complex and nuanced understanding of human behavior. <br/><br/>In broader terms, the proposed research will have practical applications to the ethical and political aspects that permeate modern anthropological research, especially the cultural affiliation of present-day peoples to past settlements. Because this project tracks the formation of historic and modern Tewa Pueblo social identity, the data collected in this project will provide information on indigenous groups that may support links to contemporary populations by looking beyond traditionally defined archaeological culture areas. This information will be disseminated in site tours and talks with local Pueblo communities, as well as detailed reports. Such information will be useful in determining cultural affiliation and past landscape use."
Collaborative Research: Apalachicola Ecosystems Project,ARCHAEOLOGY,2010-08-15,Barnet Pavao-Zuckerman,2014-06-30,Barnet Pavao-Zuckerman,"With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Thomas Foster, Barnet Pavao-Zuckerman, Roger Brown, and the Apalachicola Ecosystems Project (AEP) will advance the understanding of the dynamic relationship of humans and their physical and social environment. The AEP will use archaeological, historical, and ancient botanical data to investigate how Native American populations adapted to a changing biophysical and colonial environment. The AEP's interdisciplinary approach integrates ecological systems and human agency in the analysis of socio-ecological resilience in the face of dynamic and nonlinear changes in the political, social, and ecological environments. This project will use a unique case where the emigrant and immigrant sites of a single town are well documented. By studying the archaeological sites of Apalachicola (1715-1836) in eastern Alabama and accurately controlling for temporal variation, this project will characterize how humans dynamically adapt to and, simultaneously, affect their biophysical and social environment. Apalachicola was one of the most politically important Creek Indian towns and was, according to historic legend, the site of the origin of the Creek Confederacy. <br/><br/>The objectives of the AEP are to (1) investigate how Native Americans maintained social, economic, and ecological viability in the face of substantial and rapid change to the social and biophysical environments, (2) identify the anthropogenic effects of the Creek Indian economic strategies on plant and animal communities, and (3) better understand Native American social, economic, and ecological resilience during the Historic Period. Sections of two archaeological sites will be excavated, Apalachicola town (1757-1836) and Apalachicola Old Town (1715-1757), to measure cultural resilience throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The project will couple the archaeological investigations with historical research to elucidate broader political climate, alliances, and conflicts. Finally, the project will measure local changes in the biophysical environment through pollen cores, analysis of anthropogenic changes in the plant and animal communities, and climate variation. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the AEP is relevant to studies of resilience theory and risk management, historical ecology and environmental management. Reconstructing human impact upon, and interaction with, past environments is important to our understanding of current human affected environments. This project will contribute to our understanding of how the Southeastern Indians adapted to a diverse plant and animal environment within a changing social and economic environment. The project will also help refine our understanding of the processes of historical ecology, migration, and cultural resilience in an understudied region. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study are significant to a wide range of fields and will contribute to scientific education and descendant communities. The study of anthropogenic effects on the environment is one of the most important problems facing humans today. The Apalachicola Ecosystems Project is relevant to modern forest managers, policy makers, environmental historians, anthropologists, culture historians, and ecologists. The AEP will further understanding of how humans use culture to adapt to and modify their physical environment as well as contribute to student training."
Dissertation Research: The Rocky Mountains as Part of a Regional Model of Paleoindian Adaptations in the Western United States.,ARCHAEOLOGY,1996-03-15,C. Vance Haynes,1998-08-31,Bonnie Pitblado,"Under the direction of Dr. C. Vance Haynes MS Bonnie Pitblado will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Working with already excavated archaeological materials she will study lithic artifacts from the U.S. Plains, Rocky Mountains and Great Basin. She will focus on the Paleoindian period - from approximately 10,000 to 7,500 BP. - and conduct a detailed analysis of projectile points from Colorado and Utah since these two states together span the three geographic zones. She will also conduct a broad scale analysis of all lithic materials from nine sites, three from each of the areas. Through examination of raw material origin, manufacturing process and form of completed objects she hopes to determine the relationships between these three areas. A great deal of excavation has been conducted in both the Great Basin and the Plains and the archaeology of these areas during the Paleoindian period is fairly well understood. Much less however is known about the Rocky Mountains. Some archaeologists believe that this environmentally difficult area was inhabited year round and that separate groups of people developed a distinctive adaptation to this region. Others believe that cultures at a Paleoindian level of technology were unable to meet such a challenge. MS Pitblado will address this question through her analysis. This research is significant for a number of reasons. First it will provide information of great interest to archaeologists and help to illuminate a little understood period of U.S. prehistory. Secondly, it will shed new light on human-environment interactions and the basic ability of populations to adapt at simple levels of technology. Third, the work has the potential to make a significant contribution to archaeological methodology since it will further the development and application of techniques for the analysis of lithic materials. Finally this grant will assist in the training of a promising young archaeologist."
Investigation of Stratigraphic Manifestations of Younger Dryas Climate at Paleoindian Sites in North America,ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-06-15,C. Vance Haynes,2002-05-31,Owen Davis,"Approximately 11,000 years ago a wide range of North American large fauna went extinct over a short time period and scientists wish to understand the cause. Two main theories have been proposed: one invokes climate change and accompanying vegetation shifts. The other notes the presence of Paleoindian hunters and gatherers and sees hunting as the primary cause. In his prior work Dr. Vance Haynes has recognized the presence of a distinct dark organic strata which is present in many sites in the US West, Southwest and High Plains. It is extremely rare to find such a well defined horizon over this large an area and its presence implies a major climatic event. Artifacts associated with the Clovis culture are found under the horizon but never within or above it. Stone tools from the succeeding Folsom group occur only in or above the horizon. This fact leads Dr. Haynes to speculate that the organic layer is in fact synchronous across sites and was deposited in a very short time period. He associates the layer with the Younger Dryas cooling event, a period of major climatic change. He also notes that this coincides with a period of maximum faunal extinction. Unfortunately the organic soil horizon is not well dated and with NSF support Dr. Haynes will visit a series of sites which contain the horizon and are also important because of the archaeological and paleontological materials they contain. He will record the stratigraphic sequence and collect suites of materials for radiocarbon dating. Specific organic compounds will be isolated for stable isotope analyses to determine relative amounts of C3 vs. C4 vegetation. In this way floral change can be both noted and dated. This research is important because it will provide precise dates for past climate and environmental change in North America. This will refine the framework for understanding changes in both human behavior and faunal extinction."
"Clovis-Folsom-Plainview Geochronology, Climate Change, and the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition","ARCHAEOLOGY, SCEC, GLOBAL CHANGE",1992-03-01,C. Vance Haynes,1996-08-31,C. Vance Haynes,"Dr. C. Vance Haynes and collaborators will examine geological sections in 16 U.S. archaeological sites which bracket the Pleistocene-Holocene transition which occurred from ca. 11,500 to 10,500 years ago. During three seasons of fieldwork they will conduct geologic mapping and microstratigraphic recording in sufficient detail to understand the processes and origins, and to provide a precise stratigraphic framework for sampled sediments, fauna, pollen, diatoms, artifacts and radiocarbon samples. Pollen and diatom analyses will be conducted by appropriate specialists and a large number of samples will be dated to a precision of +- 80 years by radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometry. This research will provide increased insight into the climatic and environmental changes which marked the end of the last Ice Age and the response of humans as well as other species. Archaeological evidence clearly indicates that humans were present in North America prior to the end of the last Ice Age. These groups, known as ""Folsom"", which is the name of a specialized stone point type they employed, were widely distributed and hunted species such as mastodon. However, within what appears to be an extremely limited interval a transition occurs and ""Clovis"" peoples first appear in the archaeological record. At about the same time, several other changes seem to take place as well. Preliminary evidence indicates climatic drying and the rapid extinction of many species. While a number of archeological sites exist which span this interval, it is difficult to compare across them because of varying analytic techniques employed. The work by Dr. Haynes and his colleagues will provide the basis for synthesizing large amounts of data from these individual sites. It will also allow him to test his hypothesis that a rapid and marked reduction in rainfall was responsible for associated environmental and cultural changes. This research is important because it will shed light on a poorly understood aspect of U.S. prehistory. It will also increase our understand of climate change and human and other animal response to it."
"Dissertation Research: Spatial Organization and State Expansion in Southern Transcaucasia, 1300-600 B.C",ARCHAEOLOGY,1995-03-01,Carol Kramer,1996-12-31,Carol Kramer,"Kramer Under the direction of Dr. Carol Kramer, Mr. Adam Smith will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study Urartu settlement pattern as revealed in a series of archaeological sites. Between the ninth and sixth centuries B.C., the ancient state of Urartu spread from its capital on Lake Van, conquering much of what is today eastern Turkey, Armenia and Iranian Azerbaijan. As it expanded, Urartu imposed a new spatial order on the territories it acquired. In his research, Mr. Smith will study an number of sites in Armenia. These span a range of time and include both pre-Urartu, early and late Urartu settlements. He will employ an electronic mapping system to construct accurate site plans and supplement these data with schematic drawings on artifacts from Urartu sites. On this basis he will determine how imperial control is both reflected in and reinforced by architectural arrangement. He will study the use of space and the control of access into specific areas. This research is of interest for several reasons. First, it will shed light on the development of state level societies in a poorly known portion of the world. Secondly, it will help to develop an analytic technique with the potential for widespread archaeological use. Finally it will assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Navajo Beliefs and Behaviors Regarding Early Childhood Food Intake,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1993-05-01,Cheryl Ritenbaugh,1994-10-31,Cheryl Ritenbaugh,"This project examines the beliefs and behavior of Navajo mothers regarding control of early childhood food intake and its relationship to childhood obesity. Subjects will include all mothers of children twelve to twenty-four months of age, and the appropriate children, residing in Pinon, Arizona, a small, rural community on the navajo Reservation. Also included for the study will be other caretakers of the children, trading post managers and staff, and health care workers in the community. Ethnographic methods, including semi-structured interview and participant observation, and cognitive anthropological methods, including free listing and pile sorting, will be utilized to elicit information regarding food beliefs. Structured observation will be used to determine the dietary intake of a subsample of the children. Anthropometric measurements at various skinfolds sites will be obtained to determine which of the children are obese. Mothers' food believes will be categorized and related to the children's obesity status. Results will augment the anthropological literature regarding cultural determinants of food behavior, and will be potentially useful to nutrition educators working with the Navajo to prevent childhood obesity and thereby the early onset of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabests Mellitus."

Hohokam Ceramics and Social Organization During the Sedentary Period,ARCHAEOLOGY,1996-01-15,David Abbott,1998-12-31,David Abbott,"With National Science Foundation support Dr. David Abbott will conduct an analysis of ceramics collected from Hohokam sites located in Arizona's Phoenix Basin. He will focus on the early Sedentary period of Hohokam development and analyze potsherds carefully excavated from a number of sites. The geological region in which these are located is extremely diverse and the composition of sands and clays which potters employed varied significantly from subarea to subarea. Abbott's prior work has demonstrated that it is possible to examine sherd matrix and determine the source of the raw material. Through such microscopic and electron probe analysis he will determine the points of origin for thousands of sampled sherds. On this basis it is then possible to reconstruct sedentary period ceramic exchange systems and thus gain insight into social organization. Hohocam peoples were agriculturists who lived in a harsh semi-arid environment and who depended on large and complex irrigation systems to produce crops. Dr. Abbott has completed a similar analysis of ceramic exchange during the following Classic period and the results indicated that exchange occurred primarily within individual irrigation subsystems. This indicates that social organization and the control and management of irrigation were tied closely together. The Sedentary period work will shed light on how this system developed. Although canals were present during the Sedentary period, preliminary results indicate that exchange may not have followed the Classic pattern and were not closely tied to irrigation canals. It correct, this conclusion would contradict widely held archaeological assumptions. Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies arose. This process often occurred in semi-arid environments and researchers have postulated that the need to develop and maintain irrigation systems played a central role. Dr. Abbott's research speaks directly to this question. It also sheds light on how people at a simple level of technology were able to subsist in harsh environmental conditions. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and shed new light on America's past."
Pottery Production and Ballcourt Ceremonialism: Remarkably Sophisticated Economics Among the Hohokam,ARCHAEOLOGY,2002-07-01,David Abbott,2004-06-30,David Abbott,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. David R. Abbott and his colleagues will conduct 21 months of archaeological research focused on the unusually complex economy and the regional ceremonial network of the ancient Hohokam people. The Hohokam were desert farmers and craftsmen who inhabited hundreds of villages with populations of 200 residents or more through out southern and central Arizona from ca. A.D. 300 until A.D. 1450. During previous NSF-funded research, it was shown that nearly all ceramic containers used during the Sedentary period (ca. A.D. 900-1100) were made by few hands and were widely distributed to households across a large territory. An efficient and dependable mechanism for supply was clearly extant at that time, but by the succeeding Classic period (ca. A.D. 1100-1375) ceramic production had reverted to local manufacturing for local consumption. Those results evoke questions about how far back into Hohokam prehistory large-scale pottery production was practiced and how so many pots were so widely distributed. One hypothesis explains the Sedentary period ceramic distributions with possible periodic marketplaces associated ritual ball games played in more than 225 ballcourts spread throughout the region. These ball games drew crowds from surrounding and probably distant villages and may have served as venues where specialist-made pots and other domestic necessities were regularly bartered beyond the limits of kinship networks. This idea implies far more sophisticated economic arrangements than any previously supposed for the Hohokam. To further investigate this idea, the vessel forms and production sources of ceramic assemblages from the Colonial (ca. A.D. 775-900), late Pioneer (ca. A.D. 700-775), and early Pioneer (pre-A.D. 700) periods will be analyzed to determine how ceramic production and distribution were organized during each time period and determine for how long the sophisticated division of labor for ceramic production was extant among the Hohokam. Did it precede, parallel, or succeed the development of the ballcourt network, which began during the late Pioneer period and greatly expanded during the Colonial and Sedentary periods? The new research will also use recent chronological refinements to determine if the shift to localized ceramic production was coeval with the collapse of the ballcourt ceremonialism near the end of the Sedentary period. <br/><br/>This research is important because it contributes to building cultural evolutionary theory and highlights the remarkable accomplishments of ancient Native American peoples in the Southwest. Sophisticated economics without centrally controlled and hierarchical political institutions make the Hohokam a fascinating exception to evolutionary suppositions that link organizational complexity with hierarchical structures. As such, reconstructing how their large and intricate networks developed and worked may be pivotal for improving synthetic theories of culture change."
"An Integrated System for Digital Image Acquisition, Image Processing, and CD-Rom Publishing in Archaeology",ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-09-01,David Killick,1999-08-31,"Barbara Mills, Steven Kuhn","With National Science Foundation support, Dr. David Killick and the University of Arizona will purchase a CD-ROM system which will permit primary research data to be recorded and distributed inexpensively to other scientists. These CD-ROM `publications` will allow large amounts of visual information to be shared as high resolution pictures in a form which can be inspected, manipulated and analyzed. In many areas of archaeology, such visual material forms an essential research component but traditional publishing costs make it impractical to present more than a very limited amount. The integrated system will permit digital image acquisition, processing and archiving, linked to a system for assembling digital images, text and other graphics (such as AUTOCAD maps) in a multimedia editing system. In its initial phase, the system will be used for three main areas: 1. Archaeological metallurgy. To reconstruct prehistoric metallurgical processes both finished artifacts as well as manufacturing byproducts such as slag must be examined in detail. Microscopic thin sections and polished blocks of such samples will be recorded and annotated with text, tables of chemical analyses and other references aids. 2. Dr. Barbara Mills has examined ceramic thin sections to reconstruct prehistoric Southwestern Native American social organization. Ceramic thin sections mounted on glass slides as well as photographic images of whole vessels will be placed in a CD-ROM data base. 3. Dr. Steven Kuhn analyzes stone tools from both Europe and the Near East. On the basis of images available through CD-ROM it will be possible to conduct extensive attribute analyses."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Technological Analysis of Lead Glazed Ceramics,ARCHAEOLOGY,2014-03-15,David Killick,2015-08-31,Brunella Santarelli,"Innovation and new technologies, when properly applied, can serve as a driving forces for human betterment. The human propensity to invent is not limited to historic times and archaeology can provide insight into how it developed over millennial time scales. This project does this as well as contributing to writing the prehistory of America's past.<br/><br/>Under the supervision of Dr. David Killick, Brunella Santarelli will reconstruct the technology of production of Pueblo I (ca. 700-850 CE) glaze paints from the Upper San Juan region, southwest Colorado. These were the first glaze paints invented in the Americas. Southwestern glaze paints are unique in that they were used as decorative elements instead of as protective surface coatings. Despite recent interest in the later Pueblo IV glaze paints of New Mexico (ca. 1275-1700 CE), the Pueblo I glaze paints have remained largely ignored by archaeologists due to their limited temporal and spatial distribution. This research project proposes the first analysis and technological reconstruction of the Pueblo I glaze paints since the 1930's. It will examine the composition, microstructure and isotope signatures of the Pueblo I glaze paints in an effort to reconstruct the technology of their production. <br/><br/>This project will analyze samples collected during the Animas-La Plata (ALP) project, a large-scale CRM project carried out in the vicinity of Durango, Colorado. The ALP project was selected for sampling because of the many glaze-painted ceramics recovered and because the excavations were extensively documented and fully published. This project will use a hybrid approach, coupling advanced materials science techniques with a framework of social theory to understand the role of these ceramics in the context in which they were produced. <br/><br/>These early glaze paints have the potential to provide important information regarding both technology of production as well as the relationships and interactions of potters during this period in the Upper San Juan region, and the data collected in this project will be used to understand the social circumstances that promoted the spread and eventual decline of this technological innovation. <br/><br/>This project aims to have broader impacts beyond the contribution to the technological knowledge of Southwest ceramics. This project will provide an example of the exciting research that can be done with the stored collections of large public projects, which remain a woefully underutilized resource for intellectual inquiry. The results of this project will be disseminated to both academic and public audiences, through outreach at the University of Arizona and through peer-reviewed publications. Additionally, the data produced in this project will be submitted to online databases for public access. Finally, the research and results will be shared with the Native Nations Advisory Board, and the findings of this project may contribute to efforts for revitalization of glaze traditions arising from recent interest of this technology in modern Pueblos."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant: Seventeenth Century Metallurgy on the Spanish Colonial Frontier: Transformations of Technology, Value and Identity",ARCHAEOLOGY,2006-03-15,David Killick,2008-02-29,David Killick,"Under the supervision of Dr. David J. Killick, Noah Thomas will investigate the early seventeenth century metal working facility located within the site of Paa-ko (LA 162), in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. Paa-ko is a large adobe and masonry pueblo located on the east side of the Sandia Mountains with a long history of occupation, including pre-colonial and colonial period components. The excavation of the metal working facility over eight field seasons has revealed a diverse and intensive technological repertoire involving copper and lead smelting technologies, attempts at precious metal refining, copper smithing and iron forging. Using a synthesis of data obtained from historical sources, archaeological investigation and materials analyses, Thomas' research will investigate the ways in which these technologies were introduced and developed over the use life of the facility. <br/><br/>Ongoing research into the faunal, pollen and macrobotanical assemblages of the historic component of Paa-ko indicate a complex relationship between the introduction of European goods and animals and a continuity of food processing practices. The metallurgical analysis will also contribute to understanding processes of technology transfer during early colonial encounters between colonists and indigenous populations. Thomas' research will investigate the strategies employed by both Native American and Spanish colonial metallurgists to establish the new technology within the incipient economic, social and technical networks of the new colony. It will also investigate in detail how a new technology becomes adopted and incorporated within pre-colonial forms of practice. <br/><br/>In addition to contributing to anthropological understandings of technology transfer, this research will contribute to a more general understanding of the deep history of mineral use in the region. The economic history of the Southwest from initial colonization to its current inclusion in the global economy has revolved around the potential for the exploitation of the region's mineral resources. This project examines the changes in mineral resource use that occurred as the result of European colonization. These themes have been presented to the public in the form of public lectures to communities in vicinity of Paa-ko, in the form of site tours for the local community during the excavation of the metallurgical terrace, in general interest publications for the region, and in technical reports for the State Historic Preservation Office of New Mexico. The results of Thomas' research will also be incorporated into an exhibit at the Arizona State Museum entitled Gems and Minerals from Prehistory to the Present to go on exhibition in February 2007. This exhibit will present the deep history, social and economic significance of mineral exploitation in the region to a diverse audience including K-12th grade education institutions throughout southern Arizona."
Doctoral Dissertation Research: Chronology and Technological Styles of Nabataean and Roman Plasters and Mortars at Petra (Jordan),ARCHAEOLOGY,2008-08-15,David Killick,2010-07-31,Khaled Al-Bashaireh,"Under the direction of Dr. David killick, Mr. Khaled Al-Bashaireh will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He has collected a series of plasters, mortar and cement from the site of Petra, Jordan. These were used to cover the facades of its monuments and tombs, to bind sandstone bricks and to construct dams, water canals and cisterns. These materials will be analyzed at Yarmouk University and the University of Arizona to yield information on both their age and the materials and methods by which they were fabricated.<br/><br/>The ancient city of Petra (Jordan) has long attracted travelers, explorers, archaeologists and movie makers. The city itself has a long and complex history and served for centuries as a center for trade. The Nabataean Arabs (a nomadic tribe from the Arabian peninsula who settled in the area and laid the foundations of a commercial empire that extended into Syria) established Petra around the 6th century BC. They dominated the lands of southern Jordan and carved temples, tombs and elaborated buildings out of solid rose-colored sandstone cliffs along the canyon walls. Petra was captured by the Romans in the first century AD and then by the Muslims in the seventh century. While the outlines of this history are well known, the detailed knowledge of the construction sequence are lacking because buildings and architectural features can be difficult to date. Radiocarbon analysis of plasters themselves and the organic materials contained within them provide one means to refine this sequence. Archaeologists also focus on the process of cultural change and interaction. They wish to understand how different cultures both maintain and develop their own traditions and how they borrow from and exchange information with others. One insight into this process can be obtained through the examination of technical knowledge. As Mr. Al-Bashaireh notes, Nabataeans, Romans and Muslims had distinct ways to make a series of mortars, plasters and cements and through analysis of materials collected from Petra it will be possible to trace changes in these products over time. Twenty nine samples of mortar, 46 plasters and relevant geological materials have been collected and will be studied. Composition, structure, porosity and combustion temperatures will be determined. A wide variety of analytic techniques will be employed.<br/><br/>The research will both assist in training a promising scientist and also strengthening archaeological ties between US and Jordanian researchers."
Tin and Bronze Production in the Iron Age of Southern Africa,ARCHAEOLOGY,2006-05-01,David Killick,2009-04-30,David Killick,"The Rooiberg valley in northwest South Africa, close to its border with Botswana, is notable for its abandoned prehistoric tin mines and associated furnaces for smelting tin, and for alloying tin with copper to make bronze. When tin mining was restarted here in the early 1900's, mining engineers estimated prehistoric production at about 2000 tons of tin metal. These are the only known instances of tin or bronze production in southern Africa, but after a century of unsystematic research at Rooiberg, basic questions remain unanswered. When did tin mining begin here, and why? When did it end, and why? And what happened to the large quantities of tin produced here? <br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, a team of American, British, South African and Zimbabwean researchers will begin to study these questions through one field season of excavations in 2006. This will be followed by a year of intensive scientific analysis of the excavated remains, and of related materials from prior excavations and museum collections in both South Africa and Zimbabwe. <br/><br/>The fieldwork will concentrate upon locating and excavating smelting sites. We anticipate that the earliest evidence of tin production can be dated by radiocarbon. We do however expect that the peak of smelting activity was from the 17th through the early 19th centuries CE, a period in which radiocarbon dating is unusable. Sites in this period will be dated by optically-stimulated luminescence, backed up by the use of archaeomagnetism as a relative dating technique.<br/><br/>The technology of tin and bronze production in the Rooiberg valley will be reconstructed by chemical analysis, metallography and thin-section petrography of the excavated remains. Since it is certain that the large quantity of tin mined here was not consumed in the Rooiberg area (which appears to have been lightly populated throughout the presumed time period of production) a major aim of this project is to develop trace element and isotopic fingerprints for tin and bronze produced from Rooiberg tin and copper ores. We will measure the concentrations of trace elements in excavated tin and bronze by plasma mass spectrometry, and the ratios of stable lead isotopes by high-precision multicollector plasma mass spectrometry. <br/><br/>The final stage of the project will be to compare the trace element fingerprints for Rooiberg tin and bronze to those of tin and bronze objects from archaeological sites elsewhere in south Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and to tin produced from other potential ores in southern Africa. The archaeological finds range in age from the 13th through the 19th centuries CE, while the find spots are up to 700 km distant from Rooiberg. Thus the main aim of the project is to document the emergence of an indigenous southern African industry and the extent of the trade network through which its products passed. <br/><br/>The project will provide valuable postdoctoral training for a Zimbabwean archaeological scientists and predoctoral training for at least three graduate students from South Africa and one from America."

The evolutionary mechanisms that underpin this locomotor shift are unclear, however, with competing models suggesting differing selective pressures were responsible for the generation of bipedal traits. Research by doctoral student Adam Foster (University of Arizona), under the supervision of Dr. David Raichlen, will identify patterns in how morphology responds to behavior, contributing to our understanding of bipedal evolution. <br/><br/>The study directly tests for the roles that the amount and direction of mechanical loads (a shift from quadrupedal to bipedal standing and locomotion) have in generating adaptive morphology in the postcranial skeleton during ontogeny and adulthood, using a rat model. The research explores three main questions: (1) what role do bipedal standing and/or bipedal walking have in generating adaptive changes in skeletal morphology, (2) what is the role of ontogeny (i.e., developmental plasticity) in the generation of adaptive bipedal morphology, and (3) do morphological changes associated with locomotor shifts during ontogeny impact kinematics and energetics? Rats will be placed in a custom harness system mounted over a treadmill that allows for comfortable bipedal locomotion or static loading when the belt is not in motion, and will exercise or stand for one hour a day, 5 days a week, for 90 days. Skeletal changes are tracked through micro-CT scans, and kinematics and energetics data examine potential energy cost reductions associated with morphological changes. The findings will contribute to identifying how behavior drives morphological adaptation, and which morphologies may have been the first to evolve in response to a change in locomotion in the earliest hominins.<br/><br/>The study enhances research opportunities for undergraduates by directly involving them in data collection and analysis, and involves outreach to the community. Results from this study will be used to develop an evolution lab at a local high school; the lab and scan results will become a permanent resource for students."
Collaborative Research: Trabecular bone ontogeny and locomotor development in humans and non-human primates,Biological Anthropology,2010-10-01,David Raichlen,2013-09-30,David Raichlen,"Analyses of bone structure in living and extinct primates typically assume a direct relationship between bone form and function even though the mechanisms of bone's adaptive response to loads is not fully understood. The primary objective of this project is collecting comparative age-related data on the development of bone from a number of locations in the postcranial skeleton of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques to test an explanatory model for the patterns of change associated with locomotor development in these species. This project quantifies the changes in trabecular bone microstructure and elastic properties during ontogeny in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan data in the postcranial skeleton. The relative contributions of locomotor loading, body mass, sex, and age on the development of trabecular and cortical bone structure are examined, as are kinematic and kinetic analyses of locomotor ontogeny in a sample of juvenile modern humans to relate structural changes to changes in locomotion in humans. By quantifying the ontogenetic changes in bone structure across three different primates with divergent locomotor behaviors and developmental trajectories, the role of general developmental processes, genetic patterning, and the mechanical loading environment on bone structure are more clearly defined. The simultaneous analysis of locomotor development, bone structural and mechanical adaptations, and within and between species variation is unique and produces a more concrete understanding of bone functional morphology. Ultimately, this study will provide insight into the adaptive response of trabecular bone to mechanical loads and will provide important information regarding the functional utility of trabecular bone structure in the mammalian skeleton. <br/><br/>This study contributes to the training of undergraduate and graduate students at three universities, result in the production of a large comparative dataset of high-resolution CT and kinematic data for use by other researchers and for incorporation into the biological anthropology curriculum, has direct relevance for understanding the normal and pathological locomotor system in children and adults and will be of broad interest in orthopedics, internal medicine, bone metabolism, and biomechanics, and, finally, the results of this study will also contribute relevant data to the understanding of the prevalent health conditions of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis."
Neurobiological Rewards in the Evolution of Endurance Running in Humans and Cursorial Mammals,Biological Anthropology,2008-08-01,David Raichlen,2013-07-31,"Gregory Gerdeman, Andrea Giuffrida","Ever since Darwin, researchers have viewed the origins of bipedal walking as a defining event in human evolution. Recent research suggests that, while bipedal walking was an essential element of early hominin evolution, endurance running (ER) may have played an important role in the origins of the genus Homo. However, the ER hypothesis has not been fully tested and, given its possible significance for human evolution, deserves a more complete examination. This study presents a novel test of the ER hypothesis by examining the neurobiology of running in humans and running mammals. Human runners often report neurobiological rewards during and after running bouts (frequently termed the ""Runner's High"") that play a major role in both their motivation to run, and increase their ability to sustain high aerobic intensities over long distances. These neurobiological rewards include feelings of happiness, euphoria, well-being, anxiety reduction, and reduced pain sensation, which appear to be caused by the release of endocannabinoids (eCBs) into the bloodstream and brain. ECBs are endogenous compounds that activate cannabinoid receptors in both the peripheral and central nervous systems and lead to neurobiological rewards and pain reduction. It is possible that selection could have generated ER in several mammalian lineages by linking locomotor activities with eCB signaling and therefore, with neurobiological rewards. Evidence of the convergent evolution of neurobiological rewards for ER in humans and other cursorial mammals would strongly support the hypothesis that human ER capabilities are the products of natural selection. This study will test the hypothesis that exercise-induced eCB signaling evolved convergently in humans and cursorial mammals to motivate and reward running behaviors. ECB levels will be measured before and after running in a sample of cursorial mammals (humans and dogs) and non-cursorial mammals (mice and ferrets). The ER hypothesis will be supported if eCBs increase significantly after distance running in cursors compared to non-cursors. In addition, mood assessments will be given to human runners to examine the correlation between eCBs and neurobiological rewards.<br/><br/>This study will provide critical new data testing the hypothesis that endurance running played an important role in human evolution. This is the first study to examine the convergent evolution of neurobiological rewards for running in humans and other mammals and thus, represents a novel test of the ER hypothesis. If neurobiological rewards evolved convergently in humans and other mammalian cursors, then ER likely played an important role in human evolution. Additionally, this study will have important implications for the motivation and evolution of animal migration. Additionally, this study will have important implications for human mental health disorders. The mental health community has begun prescribing exercise to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Exercise may relieve depressive symptoms through endocannabinoid signaling since this pathway acts as an anti-depressant in animal models. This study will provide critical new information regarding how and why exercise may alleviate symptoms of these disorders. This study will also provide numerous training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Arizona and UC Riverside and will improve research infrastructure between the Departments of Anthropology and Pharmacology at the University of Arizona. Finally, this project will open new collaborations between the University of Arizona, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, and University of California at Riverside."
Collaborative Research: The Evolutionary Biology and Health Consequences of Human Inactivity,Biological Anthropology,2014-09-15,David Raichlen,2017-08-31,David Raichlen,"Recent research has associated sedentary living, and specifically, long periods of Western-style chair-sitting, with high levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD), suggesting that such behavior may be an important component of elevated rates of CVD-related morbidity and mortality in Western society. This increased risk has been attributed to a sitting-induced reduction in lower limb muscle activity, with concurrent decrease in the production of enzymes that siphon fat from the blood stream. Individuals in other cultures also are often inactive for long periods of time, yet do not seem to develop the same risk of CVD. It therefore is possible that styles of resting are more important than time spent sitting, and that people in other societies rest in ways that maintain muscle activity and thereby reduce cardiovascular disease risk. For example, it may be that squatting, potentially requiring levels of muscle activity similar to standing, is a prominent form of resting posture in non-Western societies which can be related to enhanced cardiovascular health. And as such resting behavior may have similarly characterized early human ancestors, the health costs associated with alteration in forms of resting posture also may have an evolutionary basis.<br/><br/> This research tests the hypothesis that the style of sitting in non-Western societies increases muscle activity and improves blood lipid profiles compared to Western-style sitting, thereby promoting beneficial health effects. Initial testing of this hypothesis will entail a field study of contemporary human hunter-gatherers (the Hadza people of Tanzania) in order to examine styles of rest and inactivity in traditionally-living humans. Second, focusing on a population of subjects experienced in squatting, a randomized crossover experimental design will be employed to measure muscle activity and changes in blood lipids following prolonged periods of squatting versus chair-sitting. Using these methods, the research will explore the evolutionary and contemporary human biology of resting postures in the context of health and well-being.<br/><br/> As the first study to explicitly examine human inactivity from a cross-cultural and evolutionary perspective, this project could transform our current understanding of how more sedentary lifestyles impacted functionality of modern human physiology. And in the assessment of the impact of such behavior on human biology relevant to disease and mortality rates in the US, this work also could find translation into behavioral interventions which improve public health in Western societies, as well as application in societies undergoing transitions to more Western-style inactivity patterns."
RAPID: Documenting Whistled Speech Among Chinantecans,"CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, DEL",2011-05-01,David Yetman,2012-10-31,David Yetman,"Whistled speech encodes a spoken language into a language of musical pitch that can communicate across much greater distances than the voice can shout. Whistled languages have arisen in history in cultures with inhabiting landscapes so rugged as to make face-to-face communication economically and physically costly. They have been used by herders and agriculturalists and have even been used by militaries as secret codes, as when the Guanches of the Canary Islands rebelled against the Spanish in 1488. Whistled speech in Sochiˆpam Chinantec [cso] of Cuicatlˆn, Oaxaca, Mexico has quickly fallen out of use in the community. It once had a central role in the day-to-day governing of the town where it was used as a channel to carry information across a difficult landscape informing local government authorities and committees of the times and places for meetings and carrying news up and down the mountainsides. Long distance whistled language has now been replaced with walkie-talkies. Today there are only about 25 elder men capable of using the code fluently. <br/><br/>With support from the programs in Documenting Endangered Languages and Cultural Anthropology, this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award will enable three researchers to carry out the documentation of a disappearing whistled language of Mexico and its cultural contexts of use. To respond to the serious endangerment and the absence of documentation an interdisciplinary team combining a cultural ecologist, an ethnographic linguist, and a videographer will record whistled speech in high-definition video and uncompressed audio, and work with Sochiˆpam elders to transcribe the recordings. The investigators will host an educational workshop for the community during their work in Sochiˆpam. The project materials will be useful for the speaker community in their efforts at cultural preservation, the intellectual community to understand how much of a language can remain perceptible when transformed into whistles, and to provide the raw video footage to develop a public television documentary, a valuable tool for educating the U.S. and Mexican publics about language endangerment."

Cultural Patterns of Dealing with Conflict and Aggression inFinnish Families and Society,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1997-09-15,Douglas Fry,1999-02-28,Douglas Fry,"This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the University of Arizona studying how Finnish society, which displays a marked egalitarian style of gender relations, deals with conflict and aggression. The project hypothesizes that egalitarian male-female relations have less physical and verbal aggression and more discussion, negotiation, and problem-solving than more unequal relationships, while in male-dominant relationships, the women is hypothesized to engage in more indirect aggression towards to the man than in female-dominated or egalitarian relationships. The project will use a combination of qualitative, ethnographic methods including participant-observation and informal, conversational interviews on conflict, semi-structured interviews or laypersons and experts about conflict resolution patterns and egalitarianism. This study should provide practical information as well as advance our understanding of the role of gender inequality in conflict and aggression."
"A Cross-Cultural Study of Conflict Prevention, Resolution, and Reconciliation",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2003-07-01,Douglas Fry,2006-06-30,Douglas Fry,"Within the social sciences much more attention traditionally has been paid to the study of violence, aggression, and warfare than to the multitude of ways that people use to deal with conflicts successfully without violence. Within anthropology the use of cross-cultural methods to study of conflict prevention, resolution, and reconciliation is practically non-existent. In this project an anthropologist will investigate various kinds of conflict management processes, specifically, conflict prevention techniques, nonviolent beliefs, conflict resolution mechanisms, and reconciliation processes used in numerous societies. The project will ask: do certain psychocultural mechanisms prevent aggression within and between societies? Second, do beliefs favoring nonviolence contribute to low levels of internal and external aggression? Third, do certain conflict resolution mechanisms contribute to low levels of aggression within and between societies? Fourth, do conflict prevention and conflict resolution mechanisms have interactive effects? Finally, are reconciliation processes inversely related to internal and external aggression? <br/>To address these research questions, the investigator will utilize the ethnographic data in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), an established data base on 186 societies worldwide, carefully selected to represent culture areas. In this study, 42 new descriptive and independent variables will be coded for the societies in the SCCS. These data codes then will be used to test specific hypotheses related to the central research questions. Published data codes for internal aggression (e.g., assaults, homicide) and external aggression (warfare) already exist for the societies in the SCCS and also will be utilized during data analysis. This study will provide new descriptive and cross-cultural frequency data on conflict prevention, resolution, and reconciliation mechanisms-topics that previously have received minimal attention-and also will advance anthropological understanding of conflict management by testing specific hypotheses regarding the effects of prevention mechanisms, nonviolent beliefs, conflict resolution techniques, and reconciliation processes on levels of internal and external aggression. The study is the first to examine reconciliation processes using cross-cultural data. <br/>The broader impacts include new knowledge on conflict management and reconciliation that has relevance for preventing and reducing violence and war. The findings on how violence is prevented and conflicts managed without violence across a worldwide spectrum of societies should provide some generalizable principles that could be very useful to policy-makers concerned with reducing violence. By investigating the human ability to prevent and manage conflict in ways that do not entail violence, this study provides a balancing perspective to numerous writings that place a one-sided emphasis on the human capacity for violence and war-making. An overemphasis on aggression can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as people become discouraged about the possibility of developing alternative approaches for handling conflict at various social levels. By contrast, a broad cross-cultural perspective on conflict management may contribute to the creative application of new approaches and strategies for the successful prevention and resolution conflicts within and between societies."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Studying Social Identity after Migration through Artifact Style of Everyday Objects,ARCHAEOLOGY,2014-05-01,E. Charles Adams,2016-06-30,Claire Barker,"The primary objective of this research is to understand the nature of social identity in communities that have experienced migration events and how the process of aggregation affects the differential expression of social identity on public and private scales. Given the present day extent of migration and large scale movement of people on a global scale, insight into how integration does - or does not take place - is of direct practical relevance. Archaeological examples permit such an examination within an extended time framework.<br/><br/>Under the guidance of Dr. E. Charles Adams, Claire S. Barker will explore the relationship between social identity, artifact style, and communities of practice in the late prehispanic U.S. Southwest. This research will investigate how the style associated with methods of manufacture can be an indicator of social identity. During the A.D. 1200s and 1300s, large-scale migration and aggregation into large settlements occurred throughout the U.S. Southwest. During this period of demographic upheaval, people were coming into contact and living with different, socially distant groups. Such a situation would bring diverse individual and community identities into contact and, potentially, conflict. This project will focus on three broad issues. How powerful was the process of social integration in aggregated communities? How does the social identity expressed through everyday household objects differ from the social identity expressed in objects that were used in public contexts? Is identity differently expressed at sites that experienced differing degrees of migration and aggregation? These issues will be explored through analysis of style in corrugated cooking pottery dating to the 13th and 14th century from the sites of the Homol'ovi settlement cluster located in Northeastern Arizona.<br/><br/>In archaeology, the study of social identity and cultural practice through ceramics largely has focused on decorated pottery. However, the importance of studying utility wares is often overlooked. By studying these issues through analysis of everyday objects, the detritus of commonplace domestic activity, the proposed research will demonstrate the value of the everyday for understanding the social lives of people and communities. By focusing on one settlement cluster and the sites contained therein, this project will approach identity formation and maintenance from a micro-regional, multi-scalar perspective that will produce a nuanced understanding of the effects of migration and aggregation on the expression of social identity. <br/><br/>This project will use collections held by the Arizona State Museum. Stewardship and preservation are among the most important principles of archaeological scholarship; in situ archaeological sites and artifacts are irreplaceable. By making use of existing archaeological collections, this project both preserves the in situ archaeological record and increases the attention given to the collections residing in the Arizona State Museum. This research will improve the availability of the information housed in these collections by collecting new data and synthesizing previously unpublished data. Further, this research will focus on sites and material culture associated with the ancestors of the modern Hopi tribe. A better understanding of the migration history of the Homol'ovi settlement cluster and the social processes that operated within and between the sites in the Homol'ovi settlement area will be significant both to scholars and to descendent communities. Finally, this research will contribute to a better understanding of migration, aggregation, and the processes of social integration, relevant to all societies, past and present."
"Sociopolitical Organizaton of Chevelon Ruin and the Homol'ovi Settlement Cluster, Northeastern Arizona",ARCHAEOLOGY,2002-09-15,E. Charles Adams,2006-12-31,E. Charles Adams,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. E. Charles Adams and his colleagues will conduct three field seasons of archaeological research at Chevelon Ruin. Chevelon is the third largest member, at 500 rooms, of a cluster of ancestral Hopi settlements in northeastern Arizona collectively called the Homol'ovi cluster. This cluster was occupied from A.D. 1250-1400, a period of enormous political and social change in ancient Pueblo communities throughout the northern Southwest. This change is most clearly evident in increased average village size, which tripled to more than 500 rooms during the cluster's occupation. Excavation has been conducted in five other members of the Homol'ovi cluster enabling Adams and his colleagues to establish the local chronology and study details of village reorganization associated with village growth. Because the cluster is situated along the Little Colorado River and villages were dependent on stream flow for growing crops and drinking water, they were dependent on one another economically and probably interacted politically. Chevelon is located upstream from all but one of the other villages along Chevelon Creek, one of two permanent streams flowing into the Little Colorado River that provide water to the cluster. Chevelon differs from the other villages at Homol'ovi in having five to ten times more ceramics traded from villages 100 km east of the cluster. Either Chevelon had a unique trade relationship with these eastern villages or immigrants from these pueblos lived at Chevelon. The focus of the research will be to locate plaza spaces, abutment and bonding of walls, the presence and location of spinal room blocks, and the location of ritual structures at Chevelon using a total station and wall tracing followed by excavations. An important concept identified in previous excavations in Homol'ovi villages is what we term ""enriched deposits."" Enriched deposits have high quantities of whole and unusual objects and highly formalized deposits that are associated with ritual activity. The testing program will also look for deposits that have concentrations of exchanged pottery or riparian resources unique to the Chevelon area. The relationship of these deposits to architectural units within Chevelon should inform on the distribution of wealth within the community and the nature of groups or households controlling this wealth. Heterarchal, hierarchical, corporate, and communal models of village organization will be tested. In addition, the connection of the villages through sharing Little Colorado River water suggests cluster-level organization. The location of Chevelon along a permanent stream with potentially unique fauna and flora and its distinctive ceramic assemblage identify objects that could be exchanged with other cluster members. Tracing these objects to previously excavated villages will allow the team to assess the flow of these items from Chevelon to other cluster members and whether these follow patterns associated with confederacy or hierarchical models of cluster organization. The results of this research will inform archaeologists working in the Southwest and elsewhere on the material correlates and associated behaviors to power and sociopolitical organization within non-state societies and how these are expressed beyond the level of the village."
Dissertation Research: Analysis of Prehistoric Southwestern Ceramics,ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-08-15,E. Charles Adams,2000-07-31,E. Charles Adams,"Under the direction of Dr. E. Charles Adams, Mr. Patrick Lyons will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct a ceramic analysis to reconstruct late prehistoric social organization in the Winslow, Arizona region and to determine points of origin of its inhabitants. Archaeologists have focused attention in the Winslow area because of the large number of ancestral Hopi villages present, their size, and the relative suddenness with which they appeared. Between 1,260 and 1,280 AD, after a 45 to 80 year hiatus, the region was apparently colonized by two populations, each building its own villages and bearing its own ceramic tradition. After initial contact, interaction seems to have increased, based on the presence of shared ceramic wares. Because a relatively high population density was achieved in this unpredictable desertic environment, and because groups developed integrating mechanisms across tightly defined cultural boundaries, they have been the subject of intensive archaeological interest. Abrupt clear cut appearances such as that postulated for the Winslow area are uncommon. The fact that in this case more than one group was involved offers the opportunity to study a well defined case of cultural interaction. Ceramics are usually well preserved and abundant in the archaeological record, and both their method of manufacture and decoration are determined by culture specific rules. Mr. Lyons will take advantage of this fact to compare ceramics from different villages around Winslow to determine the extent of differentiation at the time of supposed migration and the subsequent degree of stylistic intermingling. He will analyze whole ceramic vessels housed at the Field Museum in Chicago. He will also compare these to slightly earlier materials from neighboring regions in an attempt to determine points of origin. In collaboration of the University of Missouri nuclear reactor, he will conduct a trace element analysis of both potsherds and potential clay sources to match raw material source with finished product and reconstruct the extent of interaction among villages. This work will allow both cultural historical reconstruction as well as insight into the social and political organization of the region. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist. * - - v- +- ±@ + _ Ñé?¾‹Oh é' +'é?0 _ +  $ H l + ¢ ? D h + R:\WWUSER\TEMPLATE\NORMAL.DOT"
Dissertation: Understanding Ritual Reorganization in Late Prehistoric Western Pueblos: A Case Study on Homol'ovi,ARCHAEOLOGY,2000-09-01,E. Charles Adams,2002-08-31,E. Charles Adams,"Under the direction of Dr. E. Charles Adams Mr. Vincent LaMotta will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. His goal is to understand the factors which permitted effective functioning and coordination of activities of late prehistoric period Pueblo people in the Four Corners region of the Southwestern USA. The period known as the Pueblo III-IV transition, beginning in the mid-13th century AD and continuing through the early 1400s was characterized throughout the northern Southwest by major demographic shifts. The Four Corners region was largely abandoned by 1300, populations having emigrated to a few large settlement clusters with some sites housing over a thousand people. By the mid 14th century, average settlement size had increased by up to 500% or more over levels of just 50-100 years before. Aggregated Pueblo IV communities departed radically from the more typical pattern of dispersed low-density settlements that characterized the prehistory of the region up to that time. While earlier Puebloan experiments with aggregated life were relatively short-lived, Pueblo IV community patterns persisted for centuries into the historic period. These characteristics of such communities have stimulated much debate about the social mechanisms that facilitated aggregation and integration. Several archaeologists have proposed that Puebloan peoples developed rituals which played a central role in effecting and sustaining this pattern. <br/><br/>For many years the Arizona State Museum has conducted excavation at a series of Homol'ovi sites which span this transitional period and these will form the basis for Mr. LaMotta's research. He believes that ""ritual sodalities"" observed in the ethnographic present emerged during the late prehistoric period and served an important integrating function. A ritual sodality is a ceremonial organization whose membership cross-cuts kinship lines and which typically performs public and semi-public rituals. The problem, as Mr. LaMotta notes is how to identify solidalities in the archaeological record and distinguish them from other types of family and kin based ritual groups which also were likely to exist. He has developed a series of criteria which serve this goal and with NSF support will supervise the analysis of excavated faunal and floral remains to determine whether, and when in the archaeological sequence the data conform to the expected pattern. This research is significant for the insight it will provide into how complex societies arise and are maintained. The work will also contribute to training a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Prehistoric Ritual Technology: A Pueblo Case Study,ARCHAEOLOGY,1993-07-01,E. Charles Adams,1994-12-31,E. Charles Adams,"Under the direction of Dr. E. Charles Adams Mr. William Walker will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will participate in the excavation of a large or ""great kiva"" which is part of the Homol'ovi II site located in northeastern Arizona. The size of the kiva, ca. 11 m. by 6 m., makes it large both in Southwestern terms and also in relation to other ritual structures at the site. In the course of extensive excavation the site will be trenched to divide it into four quadrants which will be mapped and excavated in their entirety. Pollen and flotation samples will be collected from features and other locations to assess the ritual use of plants. The chronology of use will be determined through ceramic as well as tree ring and radiocarbon dating. In addition to the ceramic materials, lithic and groundstone artifacts as well as faunal and macrobotanical remains will be studied. In this way the history of the structure and its use can be reconstructed. In the centuries preceding Columbus complex societies developed in the U.S. Southwest. They were characterized by large population aggregations, construction of multistory ""apartment"" houses and of ritual structures. Archaeologists want to understand how complex societies develop and are maintained and for this reason have focussed on this Southwest phenomenon. Based both on archaeological and ethnographic evidence, it is known that religion played a central role both in social control and integration. Just how it functioned and changed over time however is unknown. Through a study of this grand kiva Mr. Walker will address this issue. Because ritual features are added over time the history of the structure and its use can potentially be reconstructed. This project is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of how complex societies emerge and are maintained. Mr. Walker also wants to develop new techniques both to excavate and to interpret architectural remains such as kivas and his work should set an example which may be applied in other parts of the world. Finally, the project will assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research:Exchange and Production in the U. S. Southwest,ARCHAEOLOGY,1992-10-15,E. Charles Adams,1995-03-31,Laurie Webster,"Under the direction of Dr. Charles Adams, MS Laurie Webster will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will utilize archaeological and ethnographic materials as well as historical accounts to reconstruct the prehistoric and early historic Pueblo Indian system of textile production and exchange. She will visit a number of museums which house specimens and study the methods by which they were manufactured. Because of the dry Southwestern U.S. environment many textiles preserve well in archaeological contexts and therefore it is possible to gain information on prehistoric textile use. Extensive ethnographic collections also exist and therefore one can trace changes into historic times. Textiles played a very important role in Pueblo society. In addition to their utilitarian function they were widely used for religious and other symbolic purposes. They played a major economic role and social role. When the Spanish conquered the Pueblo peoples they reorganized textile production and in some areas established an industry. Textile manufacture was also affected in more indirect ways with the introduction of new materials, such as sheep wool, dyes and weaving implements. Ms. Webster's goal is to trace changes from the pre-Spanish through Spanish period. The ultimate purpose is not to understand textiles as textiles, but rather to use them to gain insight into the Pueblo economic and social systems and to learn how this indigenous group adapted to culture change. This research is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of the relationship between material culture and social/economic organization. It will shed new light on the American past and assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: The Role Of Material Culture In Social Identification,ARCHAEOLOGY,2014-07-01,E. Charles Adams,2016-06-30,Saul Hedquist,"Under the guidance of Dr. E. Charles Adams, Saul Hedquist will examine the social uses of turquoise and other blue-green minerals in the late prehispanic Western Pueblo region of the U.S. Southwest. Scholars have long recognized the importance of turquoise among past and present Pueblo groups. Despite knowledge of its long-lasting social and symbolic importance, however, late prehispanic patterns of turquoise use remain poorly understood. This research seeks to address this deficiency and illuminate associated identity structures through an interdisciplinary investigation of provenance, style, and deposition. The project incorporates archaeology, geochemistry, and ethnography in an effort to address a central research question: How did the circulation and use of turquoise vary throughout the late prehispanic Western Pueblo region, and what are the implications for understanding interactions and identity expressions within and among newly aggregated settlements and settlement clusters? The research gains fundamental importance for the insight it will provide on how societies at a ""simple"" level of social compxity are organized. In this case the specific issue is: how do multiple groups, often speaking different languages and with different sets of customs and beliefs become integrated into effectively functioning social units.<br/><br/>The project includes three primary components. First, a comprehensive geographic information systems (GIS) database of previously documented late prehispanic turquoise occurrences will be developed to examine: 1) the regional variety and distribution of stylistic traits; 2) the regional variety and distribution of documented depositional patterns; and 3) contextual associations between turquoise and other materials. Second, regional patterns of acquisition and exchange will be explored using measurements of lead and strontium isotopes. Recent pilot studies indicate turquoise from at least three geologic locales circulated throughout the Western Pueblo world during the late prehispanic period. Additional isotopic measurements will be used to clarify the regional spread of turquoise from these (and perhaps other) sources and expose potential networks of interaction. Third, consultation with Hopi and Zuni tribal members will aid interpretations of archaeological patterns and ensure Pueblo knowledge is accurately represented in scientific research.<br/><br/>The project will foster collaboration with descendent communities by directly incorporating Hopi and Zuni participation and perspectives. In addition, through exclusive use of existing museum collections, the project promotes research with minimal impact on the archaeological record. The project's database will integrate archival data spanning more than a century's worth of fieldwork. These data will be made available to qualified individuals through the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR). Research results will be further disseminated through public talks, conference presentations, presentations to tribal members, and peer-reviewed publications.

Irina Panyushkina and Claudia Chang will conduct research to examine how climate, landscapes and prehistoric societies have interacted in Central Asia. This project involves expert collaborators and partnerships in the fields of archaeology, dendrochronology, paleoclimatology, palynology, ecology and hydrogeology in order to examine past climate changes and social transformations throughout a 2000-year prehistory of southern Kazakhstan. The research will generate new field-based datasets for modeling population dynamics, land use patterns in the grassland plains and forested mountains. The goal is to determine human response to climatic and environmental changes beginning at the transition from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600 to 900 BC) and through the Iron Age (ca. 800 BC to AD 500). <br/><br/>The research is important because it will test the direct impact of climate change on ancient societies and cultures of the Eurasian Steppe. It will broaden perspectives on the nature of climate-human interactions which influenced the social evolution of the subsequent civilizations and led to the development of the modern world. <br/><br/>Archaeological data from Semirechye (the mountain zone of the Aral Basin) suggest that during the Late Bronze Age, small, dispersed populations of mobile pastoralists occupied the upland valleys and mountains near critical pasture and water resources. Later, in the first millennia BC, these marginal upland regions led to the formation of two distinct types of settlement: larger, aggregated populations of agro-pastoralists who utilized the fertile, arable land of alluvial fans and smaller, dispersed populations of transhumant pastoralists who relocated to high elevations. By ca. 100 AD, population density and storage capacity at villages was comparable to that of early sedentary farming villages in other world regions. A marked reduction in the number of Iron Age sites took place after AD 200 probably a result of out-migration or conflict. The research will interrelate the archaeological datasets with sophisticated reconstructions of climate variability. These integrated data shall provide key insights into the adaptive responses of ancient populations to climate and environmental changes. <br/><br/>This multi-disciplinary project includes: (1) archaeological survey and site testing; (2) geophysical settlement surveys using a magnetometer; (3) C14 wiggle-match and tree-ring dating; (4) multi-scale climate and environment reconstructions from tree-ring and pollen proxies, and corresponding ice-cores. The assembled lines of evidence will be used to estimate the impact of climate change on population size and landscape productivity in this region. Furthermore, it will document the social and economic factors within Iron Age society that led to possible environmental stress such as the depletion of water sources, wood fuel and soil fertility. <br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts include 1) graduate students' field and state-of-art training in the management and interpretation of large and complex data sets, and 2) strong international collaborations between the archaeological and environmental science communities of US, UK, Kazakhstan, Germany, Hungary and Russia."
Absolute Chronology of the Pazyryk Culture and Climate Variability in the Altai Mountains Inferred from Tree Rings,"ARCHAEOLOGY, ARCHAEOMETRY",2002-06-01,Irina Panyushkina,2006-08-31,Jeffrey Dean,"With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Irina Panyushkina, Jeffrey Dean, and their colleagues will undertake a dendrochronological (tree-ring) analysis of wood from Iron Age archaeological sites in Central Asia focussing on the Scythian Pazyryk Culture (1,000 B.C.) in the Altai Mountains, which lies across Russia, Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan states. Crossdated tree-ring sequences from living trees, dead trees in glacial valleys, and archaeological timbers will be used to build a 3,000-year continuous master tree-ring chronology, which will provide calendar dates for Scythian, Tagar, Hun-Sarmatian, and Turkic archaeological sites. This achievement will be a quantum advance like that of the 1920s when dendrochronology precisely dated hundreds of Paleo-Indian sites in the U.S. Southwest. The Altai project is a scientific partnership between the United States and the Russian Federation to study the archaeology, dendrochronology, and paleogeography of Central Asia. The project integrates efforts of Russian, German, American, Kazakhstani, and French archaeological teams conducting multidisciplinary studies of Iron Age steppe nomads in the region.<br/><br/>The project will directly address (1) the absolute chronology of the Siberian Scythians and of the Iron Age in Inner Asia, (2) the place of the Pazyryk people in the general cultural and historical context of the region, (3) the extent to which climatic variability and extremes during the last few thousands years (Late Holocene) impacted nomads of the Eurasian steppe. Although diagnostic Pazyryk artifacts and decorative styles commonly are used to establish connections among the pastoral and sedentary groups of Eurasia, the insecure dating of the Pazyryk expression impedes understanding the interactions among these Iron Age societies. Application of the 3,000-year master tree-ring chronology to dating wood objects from Scythian tombs will provide an absolute chronological framework for systematizing existing archeological data and future finds. An absolute chronology for the study region will clarify ideas about Indo-European origins, the prehistory of pastoral societies before Mongol expansion into Inner Eurasia, and Scythian influence on the cultures of Asia Minor and the Mediterranean Basin. Combining the dendroclimatic records with other indicators of environmental changes will produce high resolution (seasonal and annual) environmental reconstructions for the last 3,000 years. These data will be used to assess the degree of environmental stress on the pastoral steppe nomads whose animal herds, a vital component of their economy and social organization, where highly vulnerable to fluctuations in climate and vegetation. This, in turn will indicate the degree to which climatic variability ""forced"" the sequent waves of Scythian impact on the agrarian cultures to the west."
"Collaborative Research: Vulnerable Transitions and Cumulative Embodied Stress Among Teens in High-Risk, High Stakes Pastoralism",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2014-08-01,Ivy Pike,2016-07-31,Ivy Pike,"The years between childhood and adulthood are universally recognized as a stage in normal human development. But despite the fact that scientists know that adolescence is understood and experienced differently in different cultures and societies, most studies of adolescents have taken place in Western societies. Therefore, much remains unknown about this significant period of human development. For this reason, anthropologists have recently directed increased attention to studying adolescents cross-culturally. This particular award is to a research team who ask a particularly important and timely question about the adolescent years: what are the effects of growing up in a violent environment? Unfortunately, violence is part of the daily reality for many adolescents around the world, including many in the United States. Examining the effects of violence on the adolescent years in a non-Western context will allow social scientists and policy makers to differentiate between effects that are local and cultural, and those that are universal, which is essential for developing effective strategies for buffering the effects of violence on adolescents wherever they might live. <br/><br/>The research team is comprised of cultural anthropologist Dr. Bilinda S. Straight (Western Michigan University) and biological anthropologist Dr. Ivy L. Pike (University of Arizona). The research will be carried out in a conflict-ridden pastoralist zone of East Africa where the researchers have previously collected comparative, longitudinal data on 215 households in pastoralist communities that vary by their exposure to violence. The researchers will build on that data with a sample of 660 young people. They will (1) examine the daily movements of adolescent girls and boys (ages 10-19) between settlement and pasture, cattle camp, and other activity sites; (2) monitor energy expenditure with fitness tracking devices and activity recall combined with nutritional assessments using anthropometry and dietary recall; (3) measure adolescent psychosocial stress through multiple bio-markers, validated assessment instruments, and intensive ethnographic interviews; and (4) elicit the choices, explanations, and emotions of adolescent boys and girls in the context of their varied daily experiences."
"Collaborative Research: The Violence of ""Small Wars,"" Poverty, and Health in Three Pastoralist Communities in Northern Kenya","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH",2008-09-01,Ivy Pike,2012-08-31,Ivy Pike,"Led by Dr. Bilinda S. Straight (Western Michigan University) and Dr. Ivy L. Pike (University of Arizona), an international team of anthropologists will investigate the social and health-related dimensions of violence among Pokot, Samburu, and Turkana pastoralist communities in Kenya. The researchers will seek to determine how chronic, low-intensity violence creates a special class of vulnerable and impoverished persons, making violence-created inequality distinct from other forms of poverty and inequality. The study's regional scope additionally places the current circumstances of violence into a larger context of marginalization, which permits a nuanced account of the social and political factors that shape the different experiences of intercommunity violence. <br/><br/>To create an ethnographically driven epidemiological study of violence and health, the researchers will use a mixed-methods approach. The team will sample 180 households (approximately 900-2700 individuals) in two communities (one at the borders of the violence, one removed from the borders of violent conflict) in each of three adjacent ethnic communities in chronic conflict with one another. The data to be collected include: 1) Anthropometric measures to assess nutritional condition; 2) Assessments of violence related morbidity/mortality and major injury through individual interviews; 3) Qualitative interviews on the project's key themes; 4) Oral histories of violent events for each community; 6) Wealth assessments; 7) Collection of data from health clinics in each region to evaluate patterns of use and mortality trends. <br/><br/>The research is important because it will allow social scientists to better understand the relationship between chronic, low-intensity violence, health, and inequality. The research will produce one of the first data sets that directly link increased, low-level armed conflict and shifts in health experiences. The research also has practical implications. Health research is an emerging tool for social advocacy and a politically neutral tool for international diplomacy. The research also builds international collaborations between American, German, Kenyan, and Norwegian researchers, and supports the field training of a graduate student."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Culture Change, Women, and Diabetes in the United Arab Emirates","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Biological Anthropology",2009-07-15,Ivy Pike,2011-12-31,Sarah Trainer,"University of Arizona graduate student, Sarah Trainer, with guidance from Dr. Ivy Pike, will undertake anthropological research on the relationship between culture change, weight, and disease. Her reseach will be carried out among Emirati women in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with a focus on type 2 diabetes. <br/><br/>The researcher will take a context-driven approach to understanding how social change can affect biology. She will employ mixed methods, including focus-groups, structured and semi-structured interviews, and anthropometric measurements. The goal is to obtain anthropologically grounded information regarding recent shifts in behavior related to the emergence of obesity and associated health problems. Particular areas of interest include how urban women in Dubai cope with local gender role ideals; the increased availability of non-traditional, ""fast"" foods; changing work patterns; evolving ideas about body image, risk, and health; and conflicting messages about Emirati identity. The meshing of the biological and cultural is a pivotal aspect of the study and will provide a unique perspective on obesity and diabetes in the UAE, as well as on the impact of the globalizing and local processes occurring there.<br/><br/>The research is important because the World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, seventy percent of all deaths globally will be the result of chronic disease. Many countries remain ill-equipped to face the social, political, and economic repercussions of these increases in chronic disease. Although this study focuses on the local context of these processes, its methods and perspectives can be used to consider the effects of development-driven changes in other populations around the world. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: The Causes and Consequences of Income Inequality in Rural Zambia,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2008-07-01,Ivy Pike,2010-12-31,Ivy Pike,"Graduate student Steven Cole, supervised by Dr. Ivy L. Pike, will examine the causes and consequences of income inequality in rural Zambia. The research will focus on a population of maize growers in rural Eastern Province, Zambia, where differential access to farming inputs impacts a household's food security and income level. Research that links social inequalities and patterns of biological variation is increasingly common in bio-cultural anthropology. However, much of this research privileges political-economic contexts without considering how they are individually mediated. Using health as a test case, Cole will examine the role of psychosocial stress in explaining the variable individual consequences of income inequality. <br/><br/>The researcher will carry out twelve months of field research using a mixed-methods approach. He will randomly select three study villages and gather basic population data to create a sampling frame to allow him to select a random sample of 60 households. He will survey the health status of household members twice over the course of the study (to capture seasonal variability), gathering anthropometric, perceived health, perceived stress, income, and social cohesion data. The information on household income also will be used to determine each village's Gini coefficient (to assess income distribution), another measure of variable perceived stress. He will conduct semi-structured interviews with villagers on agricultural policies, labor practices, inter-household labor transfers, and emotional responses to the widening of the income gap. These data will be analyzed statistically to elucidate some of the causes and consequences of income inequality in rural Zambia. <br/><br/>The research is innovative because it will be one of the first studies to employ intensive anthropological research methods to test the dynamic relationship between income inequality and individual-level consequences in a developing country context. The research will contribute to improved policy to improve overall health, both physical and mental, in rural areas in developing countries. The research will also contribute to the education of a social scientist."
Dissertation Research: 14th-century Ceramic Design Change and Reorganization in East-Central Arizona,ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-03-01,J. Jefferson Reid,1999-12-31,J. Jefferson Reid,"Under the direction of Dr. J. Jefferson Reid, Mr. Scott Keuren will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will use an innovative technology to examine whole ceramic vessels recovered from archaeological sites in east-central Arizona. All date from a limited time period, between ca 1275-1325 AD and document the change from the Pueblo III to IV period. The Southwest occupies an important place in Americanist archaeology because this region saw the rise of complex Anasazi civilization in a harsh semi-arid region. Lacking the wheel or domesticated animals Anasazi peoples constructed roads hundreds of kilometers in length and large multi-story apartment houses. Archaeologists wish to understand how this society developed and changed over time. The Pueblo III/IV transition is important because it marks major changes in population distribution. Many areas were abandoned and tighter and more centralized pattern appears. Preliminary data indicate that trade and other interactions between villages were altered as well. Mr. Keuren will use ceramic data in an attempt to trace the movement of people, their amalgamation and changes in production and trade strategies. Based on his own preliminary work he argues that through a very detailed analysis of designs painted on ceramic vessels, it is possible to identify micro styles each of which indicates a single shared learning pattern. By examining these styles closely, it is possible to determine how many groups are present in a village and the degree of interaction among them. Through comparison across sites, one can hopefully determine how people and the ceramics they produce moved over space. Mr. Keuren has developed computerized techniques which allow for easy storage and ready access of the ceramic designs and which facilitate their analysis. This research is important for several reasons. It will produce results of interest to many archaeologists and will increase our understanding of United States prehistory. The techniques which Mr. Keuren is developing, if successful, will have widespread applicability. This project will also assist in training a promising young scientist."
"Dissertation Research: Investment in Female Education as an Economic Strategy Among U.S. Mexican Households in Nogales, Arizona",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1997-03-15,James Greenberg,1998-09-30,James Greenberg,"This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Arizona. The project is to examine the extent to which US-Mexican households in Nogales, Arizona, invest in the education of their female members as an economic strategy. The project will select a random sample of 460 households and measure the various factors (migration history, job security, informal sector activities, household size and network characteristics, housing type) that affect their vulnerability or ability to survive economic hardship. The hypothesis to be tested is that households which have invested in their female members' education will be more stable. Methods include ethnographic participant-observation and in-depth interviews as well as a questionnaire survey of households. This research is important because the site of the project is a free trade manufacturing and assembly zone (known as maquiladora), which is an intense location for NAFTA activities. New knowledge about how local families react to these new opportunities in general, and the impact of household investment on the education of female members in specific, will advance our understanding of how working class families secure their livelihood. This knowledge will be useful to policy makers concerned with promoting the economic and social security of working class families."
"Dissertation: Linguistic Negotiation of Gender, Difference and Power by Israeli and Palestinian Women Activists","LINGUISTICS, CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY",2001-05-15,Jane Hill,2003-04-30,Jane Hill,"This dissertation research by an anthropological linguist studies the language used by Jewish and Palestinian Israeli and West Bank Palestinian woman peace and political activists. While the rhetoric used appeals to gender unity, the actual practices of coalition building reveal divisions of inequality both within and between groups. The focus of the research will be on how people manipulate specific linguistic structures (how things are said) and not simply semantic content (what is said) in order to negotiate identities and goals. The student will record speech in organizational meetings and public events, as well as interview activists, individually and in small groups, to gather demographic information, gender and national ideologies. She will test hypotheses concerned with how women's attempts to create a cohesive women's activist community correlate with their ability to maximize gendered language practices within Israeli Hebrew and Palestinian Arabic; and with how code-switching (switching between two or more languages or dialects) is used to attain personal and political goals. The research should advance our understanding of how linguistic structure and practice affects political activity and will further our understanding of the ways in which Israeli and Palestinian women peace and national activists translate international phenomena, such as peace treaties and global feminism, into local realities of building or failing to build bridges across boundaries of difference to achieve common goals. In addition it will add to our knowledge of this important region of the world"

Research will take place primarily on the Navajo Indian Reservation, with multiple levels of analysis being pursued. These levels include: 1) identification of the uses to which computers and related artifacts are applied; 2) microanalysis of instances of computer use, focusing on the relationship between Navajo conversational patterns and the interactive demands imposed by computer software; and 3) attention to the economic and political environments into which technology is introduced. Methods will include ethnographic observation and interview techniques, as well as the use of video and audio recordings (and transcription) to capture and identify patterns of behavior and problems of interaction at the micro analytic level. Results will be of interest to studies of Native American relations with the dominant culture; culture, science and technology programs; discourse centered approaches to culture change; and studies in human-computer interaction and inter ethnic communication. *** v &< t 2 T & | PR&+D & T y ZX&+E & U y : r w ; v V N c < u & D & D & D ! ^& D & T 2 + & \ 6 8 N < u P ; w 4 4 N v & 2 T > t > tJ & 4 p v a t 4 r ? &> ti & 4 t k v t 4 B 8 & E s F _^ZY X SQW& = u & ! !

Dendroclimatic Characterization of Southwestern Paleoclimate During the Past 2000 Years,ARCHAEOLOGY,1992-07-01,Jeffrey Dean,1993-12-31,Donald Graybill,"Drs. Dean and Graybill will continue their dendroclimatological work to reconstruct past climates in the United States Southwest. Because the size and configuration of annual growth rings in trees are affected by changes in rainfall and other environmental variables, it is possible to use them to reconstruct past climatic change. Also, since tree rings are deposited on an annual basis, they permit an accurate dating of this change. Drs. Dean and Graybill will add to an already substantial data base through the analysis of additional cores from living trees in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. Their preliminary work show a major climatic peturbation at approximately 1300 AD; this corresponds to a time of major cultural change in the Southwest. The Arizona team will focus their attention on this issue. They will reconstruct changing annual and seasonal variations in precipitation, temperature, growing season length, the Palmer Drought Severity Index, and changes in stream flow. The Southwestern United States saw the rise, in pre Hispanic times, of complex cultures which covered large portions of several states. These archaeological complexes expanded and contracted over time and the largest disintegrated before the arrival of the Spanish. Archaeologists have hypothesized that these cultural changes were in fact responses to variation in the environment and that the Southwest offers an excellent change and human response. The tree ring data will significantly aid in analyses of this kind. This research will be important not only for archaeologists, but also paleoecologists and scientists interested in climate dynamics and changes. Changes in temperature and precipitation which are of such concern today occurred many times in the past. It is important both to understand them and to learn how human societies responded."

Dendroarchaeology of the Navajo Occupation of the Southwest,ARCHAEOLOGY,2000-07-01,Jeffrey Dean,2003-06-30,Ronald Towner,"With National Science Foundation support Drs. Jeffrey Dean and Ronald Tower will conduct dendrochronological analysis on a massive collection of wood collected from both prehistoric and historic Navaho sites. Assembled in response to a court case involving land claims, this collection of great potential anthropological siginficance was only partially studied and this award will allow detailed analysis and the construction of a readily accessible data base which will be of value to a wide range of scientists.Dendrochronological information from other projects will also be standardized and included. Drs. Dean and Tower will also use the data to address a series of anthropological questions. <br/><br/>The project will significantly refine the chronology of events and processes important for understanding the Navajo adaptation to the Southwest since dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating, is the most accurate and precise archaeological dating method available to scholars interested in the recent past. Although the Navajo are relative latecomers to the US Southwest and arrived after 1,200 their occupation predates Spanish arrival and thus they adapted to this major transition. They also adopted pastoralism as a major subsistence strategy. Thus archaeologists can gain insight into the processes of cultural change and adaptation through the study of their past. The dendrochronological data will allow one to address questions of Navajo social organization and change and relate shifts in settlement pattern and social organization to both environmental and social variables. Impacts of the introduction of metal tools and horses, timing and mechanisms for the incorporation of non-Navajos into Navajo culture, the consequences of the transition to pastoralism and a range of other issues can be examined. The project will also aid in calibrating other dating techniques such as radiocarbon, archaeomagnetism, ceramic seriation and obsidian hydration."
Dissertation Research: Archives Analysis of the Development of Archaeological Tree-Ring Dating,ARCHAEOLOGY,1996-04-01,Jeffrey Dean,1997-09-30,Stephen Nash,"Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Dean, Mr. Stephen Nash will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will examine the archives and unpublished documents of a number of scientists who helped to found and expand the technique of tree ring dating and will analyze sample lists from laboratories which pioneered this approach. He wishes to understand how the development of dendrochronology affected the practice of archaeology in the United States and also how archaeology itself served to guide the direction the technique took. Until the 1920s, archaeologists in the United States had no means to date prehistoric events and chronologies were all relative rather than absolute. Tree ring dating provided the first of the many techniques now employed which can assign absolute dates. It was first developed in the Southwestern United States and is now widely used in this region. Because dendrochronology is based on the analysis of variation in the thickness of annual tree rings which in turn are dependent on local climatic events, chronologies must be developed independently from region to region. What Mr. Nash notes is that early in its history, researchers worked in a number of areas as far afield as Alaska to establish tree ring chronologies. Ultimately however all were abandoned and it is only in the Southwestern U.S. where the technique took hold. Mr. Nash wishes to examine this process and understand why different outcomes emerged. This research is important for several reasons. Archaeology is heavily technique dependent and is driven, in significant measure, by the development of new analytic techniques. The results of Mr. Nash's study will extend well beyond tree ring dating itself. The project will also assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
"International Conference on Tree-Rings, Environment and Humanity",ARCHAEOLOGY,1994-02-15,Jeffrey Dean,1995-07-31,Jeffrey Dean,"9320003 Dean This grant will provide support to allow scholars from outside the United States to participate in the 1994 ""International Conference on Tree Rings, Environment, and Humanity: Relationships and Processes."" In particular, effort will focus on assisting researchers from the third world and Eastern Europe. Without NSF support, such individuals could not attend. In temperate regions of the world, trees add rings annually and differences in the thickness and chemical composition of the rings are determined by local environmental factors. Resultant series from mature trees may cover hundreds of years and provide excellent information on environmental change. Tree rings also serve a valuable dating function since rings from archaeological sites can be matched to master sequences. Tree ring research is conducted in many parts of the world and the results are of value to a wide range of scientists. For these reasons, international conferences which bring together diverse groups of scientists are extremely important and the 1994 meeting will serve this function. The amount of dendrochronological research in the developing world has increased significantly in recent years. Therefore it is particularly important to have representation from scholars in these regions. ***"
Austronesian societies: reading social structure from the genome,"CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, HSD - AGENTS OF CHANGE, HSD - MODELING HSD",2004-09-01,John Lansing,2007-08-31,"Joseph Watkins, Michael Hammer, John Miller, Tatiana Karafet","Intellectual merit:<br/>In recent years it has become evident that genetic data can provide evidence about aspects of human social behavior. But so far there have been few studies on this topic. One reason for this neglect is that there are nonlinear relationships among the various behavioral factors that can influence patterns of relatedness, such as marriage rules, migration, language drift and historical changes in modes of production. This Human and Social Dynamics project will attempt to systematically analyze the relative magnitude of these parameters and to assess their effects. While most current research focuses on genetic structure at the population level, this project will use non-coding genetic markers to study the emergence of patterns of relatedness among individuals within communities. Results from previous research show that a change in mode of production (from tribal horticulture to irrigated rice production) leaves clear traces in the genetic patterns of small Balinese communities. This project will look for comparable genetic signatures in neighboring populations. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the major variables that affect patterns of relatedness among human groups. A second goal is to explore whether patterns of relatedness are correlated with people's willingness to cooperate with various categories of persons (such as males and females, kin and nonkin, within and between groups). In this way the researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the historical development of human social structures and their possible consequences for sociality. To address these questions, the project will collect DNA from communities in Indonesia and the Pacific where good archaeological data on the age and relatedness of settlements exists which can be used to test assumptions about migrations and population histories based on genetics. Statistical analysis of the genetic data will be supplemented with computer simulations because standard population genetics models assume that the dynamics have reached equilibrium, an unwarrantable assumption for the short time spans of concern here. The project's SAIL agent-based modeling platform will be enhanced to explore the effects of behavioral parameters affecting genetic population structure, in particular the ways in which patterns of relatedness unfold over time spans in the range of 100-10,000 years. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>This project will result in the creation of new analytical tools, both statistical and computational, to investigate genetic population structure at the fine-grained level of resolution provided by microsatellites. It will also provide a computational framework for integrating genetic analysis with models of language evolution, and make all of these tools publicly available. These tools will open new possibilities for the empirical study of fundamental anthropological questions. The broader impacts of the project will also include training for undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in a wide array of theoretical and experimental skills. The project will utilize three existing IGERT programs at Arizona, the Santa Fe Institute REU summer program, and the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) program to identify and support under-represented minorities in laboratory research and summer schools. In addition, a video about the project will be produced by a leading British film-maker."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Socio-ecological analysis and modeling of Q'eqchi' Maya Milpa Agriculture in Toledo District, Belize",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2007-01-01,John Lansing,2008-06-30,Sean Downey,"Graduate student Sean S. Downey, supervised by Dr. J. Stephen Lansing, will investigate the social network structure, ecology and economics of Q'eqchi' Maya milpa agriculture in the Toledo District, Belize. Historical patterns of interaction in coupled human and natural systems are as yet poorly understood. The relationship of Maya farming communities to milpa agriculture is particularly subtle because it involves complex patterns of hierarchical and common-pool management of an agricultural system that is embedded in both subsistence and market economies. Because of its long history and importance for understanding the historical dynamics of Maya societies, milpa agriculture has been extensively studied and half a dozen plausible hypotheses have been advanced to explain features of this coupled system. These hypotheses address the problem at different scales, from the short-term effects of market fluctuations, labor requirements or State interventions to the idealized behavior of a generalized model of the system framed in the context of ecologist C.S. Holling's concept of adaptive cycles. Downey will conduct extended fieldwork in five Q'eqchi' villages where he will conduct household interviews, and interview local leaders. He will collaborate with an ecologist to create a GIS map of the milpa fields surrounding these villages and to collect soils samples. These data will be analyzed using cutting-edge spatial explicit agent-based modeling techniques. Grounding the adaptive cycle in observations of the demographic, ecological, and economic cycles in the Toledo District promises to test its utility for explaining the dynamics of a real human system, and may help explain the long-term resilience of Q'eqchi' Maya milpa agriculture."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Emergence of Indigenous Environmental Knowledge: Cognition, Interpretation, Perception and Social Labor in an Indonesian Society",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2011-02-15,John Lansing,2013-01-31,Yancey Orr,"Doctoral student Yancey Orr (University of Arizona), under the supervision of Dr. J. Stephen Lansing, will research how differences in environmental knowledge emerge within highland Balinese communities in Indonesia. This research will focus on multiple levels of how people relate to and interact with their environment and in so doing address basic anthropological questions about the generation of knowledge from experience. Research will address topics such as how individuals understand ecological interactions, interpret the behavior of animals and visually perceive landscapes. The researcher will use data collected from cognitive science experiments and interviews conducted among wet rice agriculturalists and craft producers. This information will be used to see how directly experiencing the environment through labor and observation affects knowledge and skill.<br/><br/>This research is important because it is a departure from existing studies of environmental knowledge which have typically focused on classification schemes which take linguistic groups as the unit of analysis. Instead, the proposed research is aimed at uncovering the difference in environmental knowledge within communities and how people come to have such knowledge. The research will contribute to cognitive science research on mental models and their development. Beyond addressing questions within anthropology, this research has practical application for Bali as its highlands, once the agricultural center of the island, have, in many areas, been transformed by craft production into servicing tourists. The effect that this change in the labor landscape has on Balinese knowledge of the environment is a component of this study."
RAPID: Critical transitions in at-risk Balinese subaks,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2011-08-15,John Lansing,2014-07-31,John Lansing,"The usual state of affairs in nature is one of populations fluctuating around some trend or stable average. Occasionally, however, this scenario is interrupted by an abrupt shift to a dramatically different regime, as when the populations of many species suddenly jump to different abundances in synchrony in the open ocean. The obvious intuitive explanation for such changes in nature is the occurrence of a sudden large external impact. However, theoreticians have long stressed that this need not be the case. Even a tiny incremental change in conditions can trigger a large shift in some systems if a critical threshold known as ""catastrophic bifurcation"" is passed. Intuitively, this is like the tipping over of an overloaded boat when too many people move to one side. A question of interest is whether such tipping points also exist in actively managed ecosystems, like irrigated rice paddies.<br/><br/>In spring 2011, a pilot study of traditional, small-scale irrigation systems (called subaks) on the Indonesian island of Bali produced the first empirical evidence for the presence of multiple regimes in an actively managed social-ecological system. One group of four subaks responded confidently to economic and environmental challenges, while a second group of four experienced a rapid decline. Subaks have existed on Bali since the eleventh century, but most are now at risk, and last year a thousand hectares of terraced fields went out of production. Signs that the subak system is under severe threat led to a proposal from the Government of Indonesia to create a UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape to support the subaks. For the World Heritage to succeed, it is vital to understand what causes subaks to tip from one regime to another. This project will train Indonesian researchers to use the new multi-scale analytical methods developed for the pilot study, to investigate tipping points in 23 subaks. This study will also evaluate the potential of the new methods for understanding critical transitions in other social-ecological systems."
Dissertation Research: A Study of Zhoukoudian Locality 15,ARCHAEOLOGY,1997-07-01,John Olsen,1999-06-30,John Olsen,"Under the direction of Dr. John Olsen, Mr. Xing Gao will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze archaeological material collected from the very important site of Zhoukoudian Locality 15 (ZL15), and clean the original profile of the excavation to describe the stratigraphy and collect materials for geological and chronological analysis. `Zhoukoudian` includes a series of sites which together likely span a major part of the last Ice Age and therefore probably represent an interval of over half a million years. The majority of the archaeological work at these sites predates World War II and is best known for the fossil Homo erectus crania which were recovered in association with faunal remains and stone tools. This East Asian hominid material has recently been a subject lively interest because it is uncertain whether the lineage they represent terminated prehistorically or whether a link exists with current Asian peoples. In this context ZL15 is particularly important because preliminary analysis indicates that in its lowest level it overlaps with the Homo erectus material in time and that the uppermost level may be fairly recent in date. It thus may provide a needed bridge. However the abundant cultural and faunal materials from the site have not been studied and the geology and chronology has not been addressed using modern techniques. Mr. Gao will conduct both field and laboratory research. In the field he will survey Zhoukoudian Hill and the immediately surrounding area. He will clear the ZL15 section and collect sediment, faunal and floral (including pollen) samples which will be subject to detailed analysis including absolute dating, palynological analysis and pedological and sedimentological study. Uranium series dating on fossil bone and speleothems, fission-track dating on ash and burned materials and amino acid racemization and electron spin resonance dating of fossil teeth will help to determine the ages of the individual levels. Approximately 10,000 pieces of worked stone were recovered from the site and Mr. Gao will conduct typological and technological analyses of these. He will also, with the help of colleagues, study the faunal remains both to identify species represented and to reconstruct subsistence practices. This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the basis for the physical variation observed among human populations today. It will increase our understanding of the prehistory of a little known region of the world and provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also assist in the training of a promising scientist."
Improving Research Access to the Comparative Zooarchaeology Collections of the Arizona State Museum,SYSTEMATIC ANTHROPOLOGICAL COL,1998-08-01,Lane Beck,2003-07-31,Mary Stiner,"The Arizona State Museum at the University of Arizona holds two important comparative faunal collections. One, assembled over many years by Dr. Stanley Olsen was obtained through many government and government-regulates sources and include, for example, road killed animals and donations by zoos of deceased animals. A second collection was assembled from similar sources by the National Park Service. Thus species identities are known. Together the materials include not only a wide range of mammals but also fish, birds and reptiles. Currently the materials are poorly stored and catalogued and therefore it is difficult for researchers to use them. The Arizona State Museum has renovated laboratory space for the collections and with National Science Foundation support Drs. Beck and Stiner will: purchase new storage cabinets to facilitate access to the materials; complete anatomical and taxonomic inventorying and labeling; clean the many skeletons which have adhering grease, dust and other organic matter; and finally create a user-friendly computerized cataloging system which will both help researchers and also ensure that the collections are protected from improper handling. Non-human faunal remains are common in many archaeological sites and this is particularly true in the US Southwest where dry conditions lead, in many sites, to excellent bone preservation. Such materials are extremely important to archaeologists because they serve as indicators which allow the reconstruction of past environments. Most bones recovered in archaeological contexts are food remains and result from hunting and herding activities. Through their analysis it is possible to reconstruct the diets and subsistence practices of past groups and, in many instances, gain insight into their economic and social systems as well. To conduct such analyses comparative skeletal material of known species is essential and the Arizona State Museum faunal collections are scientifically important in this context. They contain a wide range of species from North and Middle America and, although difficult to access at the present time, they have still seen extensive archaeological use. This grant will improve their availability significantly."
"Producing ""Domestic Violence"": Gendered Suffering, Women's Rights, and the State in Ecuador",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2007-05-01,Linda Green,2008-10-31,Linda Green,"Graduate student Karin Friederic, supervised by Dr. Linda B. Green, will undertake research on the relationship between state and NGO penetration into a formerly isolated area and intimate partner violence in a remote area of coastal Ecuador. Both government agencies and NGOs have undertaken recent campaigns against domestic violence. The growing presence of state and non-governmental (NGO) initiatives has inspired new discourses of citizenship and human rights. The researcher asks if these discourses affect people's perception of the state's role regarding women's rights and family violence and under what circumstances people may choose to act upon new understandings of themselves as rights-bearers.<br/><br/>To answer these questions, the researcher will conduct comparative ethnographic fieldwork in two communities with different levels of participation in state and NGO-sponsored initiatives. She will conduct formal and informal interviews, hold focus groups, and interview officials in state agencies and NGOS. Historical research and institution-based interviews will be utilized to determine forms of state and NGO involvement, changing laws and policies regarding domestic violence, and examine underlying human rights discourses. This yearlong study will build upon extensive preliminary research on gender relations and family health in the region . In all, mixed methods will be utilized to deepen understanding of the dimensions of family violence, to identify effects of human rights awareness over time, and to situate local experiences of violence in a national context. <br/><br/>The research is important because intimate partner violence is a growing problem worldwide. Considering high rates of development and modernization in places worldwide beset by intimate partner violence, understanding the effects of human rights awareness in resource-poor areas is critical to advancing scholarship and designing appropriate responses. Thus, this research will contribute to the anthropological literature on family violence and theory about local effects of state institutions, and contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: A Social Science Investigation of Violence along the Migrant Trail in Mexico,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2008-09-01,Linda Green,2011-02-28,Wendy Vogt,"University of Arizona graduate student Wendy Vogt, advised by Dr. Linda B. Green, will undertake research on the violence experienced by Central American migrants travelling through Mexico to the United States. Mexico has become a major transit country for Central American migrants hoping to reach the United States. Increasingly, these migrants have violent encounters, particularly between Guatemala and Mexico City. Vogt's research will be focused on what produces this violence and why it has increased in recent years.<br/><br/>Vogt will employ a multi-methods approach. She will use archival records in southern Mexico and Mexico City to document changes in government policies towards immigrants as well as recent changes in economic patterns in the communities through which the migrants pass. In addition to the archival component, Vogt will identify three key communites along the migrant trail. In each of these communities she will employ ethnographic methods such as participant observation, structured and semi-structured interviews, and oral history elicitation. These data will allow Vogt to link local experiences with larger national and international processes, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to determine at how these external factors are mediated locally through everyday social relations between and among Central American migrants and local Mexican residents. <br/><br/>This research is important in that it will contribute to social science theory about how changes in national and international processes connect with regional and local lives. The research also may contribute to developing policies for protecting both migrants and the communities through which they pass from escalating violence. Finally, the research will contribute to the education of a social scientist.<br/><br/>An anthropological focus on the journey will contribute to a more complete understanding of how migration processes and violence impact not only migrants, but reshape the lives of multiple actors in meaningful and material ways."
"Support for Participation in the Workshop on Climate and Society on the Colorado Plateau, AD 500-1600; Santa Fe, New Mexico; May 10-13, 1999","ARCHAEOLOGY, PALEOCLIMATE PROGRAM",1999-05-01,Malcolm Hughes,2000-04-30,Jeffrey Dean,"This award supports a workshop, in conjunction with the Santa Fe Institute, to explore the interface between climate and society by focusing on the Colorado Plateau for the period of approximately one thousand years before the arrival of Europeans (broadly AD 500-1600). This region and period is of interest because its climate is relatively well known, at seasonal to annual resolution, and much of what is known about the human societies has a similarly firm chronological base. This will help us understand the links between known patterns of cultural changes and the physical environment in which they occurred. Thus the primary goal of the workshop will be to stimulate productive interchange between those with knowledge and understanding of climate variability on the one hand, and those able to speak to questions of cultural change, on the other. The workshop is scheduled to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico (10-13 May, 1999)."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Transitions To A Nomadic Lifestyle,DDRI Archaeology,2015-05-01,Maria Zedeno,2016-04-30,Brandi Bethke,"PhD Candidate Brandi Bethke, of the University of Arizona, will examine the extent to which the adoption of the horse altered landscape uses, bison hunting practices, and worldviews of the Blackfoot during the protohistoric and historic periods in the northwestern Plains of the U.S. and Canada. Inspired by the richness of hunter-gatherer archaeology in the northern Plains, theoretical and methodological advances in geospatial mapping, and Blackfoot traditional knowledge, this work provides new insights into the region's equestrian culture and society. Employing a framework that integrates archaeology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), social history, and ethnography, Bethke's research will provide a contemporary model and nuanced narrative of the influence of the horse on Blackfoot lifeways. Specifically this research will answer the question: to what extent (if any) did the Blackfoot become true nomadic pastoralists? Overall Bethke's work provides an opportunity to evaluate and update the history of the horse and its incorporation into social, economic, and political systems of nomadic hunters on the northern Plains, a story that is integral to the United States' shared heritage and history of western expansion. More broadly, this work will promote an archaeological practice that is not only scientifically sound but also responsive to the traditional knowledge and practices of Blackfoot tribal members. Present-day Blackfoot peoples offer unique perspectives and hold significant knowledge regarding cultural change associated with the introduction of the horse among their ancestors. This collaboration and constructive dialogue between archaeologists and Blackfeet non-archaeologists will benefit the discipline of archaeology in that it will provide new modes of analysis for interpreting relationships between humans and their domesticated animals both in the past and present. <br/><br/>Bethke's work will refine and expand models developed in earlier works in order to evaluate how the transition from a bison-centered to a horse-centered lifestyle altered land use patterns as the Blackfoot began to follow habits of horses instead of bison for their own annual cycles of subsistence activities, integrative ceremonies, labor organization, economy, and trade. Additionally, while the socio-economic consequences of the horse have been studied from a historical perspective, the archaeology of this transition remains ambiguous. This study will integrate locational information of multiple archaeological site types from Montana, Alberta, and Saskatchewan with historic and ethnographic data, in order to produce a comprehensive GIS database that will then be used to analyze shifts in land use patterns over the whole of Blackfoot territory that is not limited by modern geopolitical borders. In this way Bethke's research presents a new, archaeological dimension to the dynamics of the Blackfoot equestrian transition by incorporating material culture with traditional knowledge, historic accounts, and scientific data into a multi-scalar, transnational interpretation within the framework of world pastoralist studies. Pastoralism as a mode of production has never before been formally considered as a way of life experienced by Native North Americas. This project will therefore contribute new theoretical and methodological approaches as well as substantive data to our understanding of hunting and pastoralism among people of the North American Plains."
"Land Use and Chronology and GeoPolitical Processes Among Late Prehistoric Communal Bison Hunters, Montana",ARCHAEOLOGY,2012-12-01,Maria Zedeno,2014-11-30,Jesse Ballenger,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Maria Nieves Zede_o, in partnership with the Blackfeet Tribal Historic Preservation Office, will build a chronology of Late Prehistoric bison driveline systems and kill sites, as well as associated campsites located on the Two Medicine River, Montana. The objective of this chronology is to ascertain whether multiple driveline systems and kill sites were used by interacting generations and, if so, whether the management of these sites and the surrounding environment led to the formation of territories among seasonally mobile communal bison hunters. More broadly, this research will refine the understanding of big-game hunter geopolitics and its material imprint in the landscape prior to the arrival of European goods and people into the northwestern Plains.<br/><br/>The sites to be incorporated in the valley-wide chronology were surveyed and mapped by Zede_o and team in 2009-2012 as part of the Kutoyis Archaeological Project, which has been partially funded by NSF (BCS 0918081). The survey produced abundant evidence of planning, construction, and maintenance of fourteen bison driveline systems. These sites are large (9-16 km sq) funnel-like arrangements of surface stone features that connected bison gathering basins to a cliff or ""jump."" While there is strong empirical evidence that these sites were built under the same template and architectural tradition, it is yet unknown whether their use-span overlapped. The proposed research will (1) obtain optical lumenescence dates from architectural features, (2) obtain radiocarbon dates from bison bone exposures associated with the driveline systems and from hearths and, (3) establish the chronology of two paleo-fire assessment sites in the heart of the survey area, to determine whether fire was used in grassland management at the same time as the bison hunting sites. <br/><br/>Hunter-gatherer territories and territoriality are among the most enduring topics in anthropology. The proposed chronology will expand the understanding of land tenure among pedestrian big game hunters, and answer questions about how communal bison hunters maintained continuity of use and occupation of their prime hunting grounds while being away one-half of the year. The spatial and temporal scales that will be used to link diverse archaeological, chronological, and paleo-ecological data have not been previously applied to the late prehistory of this region and thus this project will stand as a conceptual and analytical model to be tested, or contested, in the future. <br/><br/>Since its inception, the Kutoyis Archaeological Project has been explicitly committed to placing archaeology at the service of the Blackfeet Tribe so that their traditional knowledge may be complemented and enriched with scientific data. This project will help to establish the antiquity of the Blackfeet's presence in the valley and to assert their rights to protect cultural resources. This project remains committed to providing archaeological training to students, tribal para-archaeologists, and local residents of the Two Medicine Valley and to inspiring Native American youth to select archaeology as their future career."
"Study of Prehistoric Ceramic Technology at Point of Pines, Arizona",ARCHAEOLOGY,1995-07-15,Maria Zedeno,1997-12-31,Maria Zedeno,"Zedeno With National Science Foundation support Dr. Maria Zedeno will analyze a sample of archaeological ceramics from the site of Point of Pines located in east-central Arizona. The site saw the development of large multi-ethnic communities between ca. AD 1250 to 1400. It presents a strong prehistoric case for migration and co-residence and well dated architecture and human remains provide a secure background for the proposed ceramic study. Dr. Zedeno will identify local ceramic traditions, nonlocal ceramics obtained before migration occurred, nonlocal ceramics associated with immigration episodes, local manufacture of foreign pots, and development of hybrid technologies. This will be accomplished through the application of neutron activation and petrographic analyses to 20 samples of decorated and plainware shreds and the reconstruction of manufacturing technology. A survey to identify and sample raw material sources will also be conducted. One goal of archaeologists is to trace the movement and intermingling of different cultural groups and often this is extremely difficult to do given the limited nature of the archaeological record. The Point of Pines region is important because data derived from a number of sources indicates that just such immigration and mingling did occur. Because of its widespread use and its durability, abundant pottery remains are recovered on many sites and Dr. Zedeno will use the controlled Point of Pines situation to determine how ceramics are affected by these social processes. The work is important not for the information it will provide about this site but because the insight gained will provide a useful archaeological tool which can be used to analyze ceramics in many parts of the world. The potential impact of this research is extremely broad."
The Complex Organization of Communal Bison Hunting: Revisiting the Late Prehistory of the Northern Plains,ARCHAEOLOGY,2009-09-01,Maria Zedeno,2012-12-31,Maria Zedeno,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Maria Nieves Zede_o and a team of colleagues and Blackfeet collaborators will conduct two seasons of archaeological fieldwork on the US northwestern Plains. Together they will examine the relationships between social investment in communal bison hunting and organizational complexity among Late Prehistoric hunter communities who inhabited the foothills and prairies of the Montana-Alberta border between AD 1050-1660. <br/><br/>The centuries preceding the adoption of the horse by North American bison hunters were marked by important technological advances and demographic processes that visibly transformed the physical and social landscapes at various scales. Evidence of landscape engineering at the Late Prehistoric Kutoyis locality in north-central Montana will be explicitly targeted in order to evaluate large-scale bison harvesting and concomitant development of social, political, and ritual structures and practices. The research team will conduct archaeological mapping of domestic and nondomestic structures, excavation of kill and processing features, and a host of paleoenvironmental and geophysical analyses to answer the following questions: (1) Did economic intensification shape the landscape at Kutoyis and how? (2) Is there any evidence of regulatory social action in the architecture of Kutoyis? (3) Was the Kutoyis landscape shaped by integrative mechanisms such as communal rituals? (4) Are the agencies and practices of individuals and groups visible in the material record of bison hunting at Kutoyis? <br/><br/>Kutoyis, also known as the Two Medicine Bison Jump Site, is located in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Glacier County, Montana. Kutoyis. It consists of a vast complex of rock features and bone scatters extending over 13 km2 on a plateau overlooking the Two Medicine River and in its floodplain. Remote and little known, this is nonetheless one of the largest and most significant Blackfeet heritage sites in the region. The completeness and intricacy of the drive line system, the multiple kill episodes, the existence of a corral / processing component, and the presence of two large campsites with initial evidence of architectural variability and one possible ritual component in close proximity to the kill site, make the Kutoyis locality a strong analytical case for investigating the articulation of social investment, landscape engineering, and material imprints of organizational complexity.<br/><br/>This study will provide the opportunity to evaluate and update deeply set models of sociopolitical organization that have characterized archaeological and anthropological approaches to big game hunters in general, and to northern Plains bison hunters in particular. It will integrate diverse archaeological components and data sets, paleoecology, and ethnographic information into a multi-scale landscape approach to bison hunting. Finally, it will furnish a substantial amount of new information to augment current knowledge of northern Plains prehistory. As a collaborative endeavor with the Blackfeet Tribe, the research has great transformative potential: it will incorporate an underrepresented constituency into archaeological research, and will promote archaeological practice that is not only scientifically sound but cognizant and responsive to the traditional knowledge and practices of this constituency. This project will create multi-year research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and a participatory model of archaeological investigation for them to follow."
"Paleoclimate, Landscape Evolution, and the Transformations of Prehistoric Agricultural Technology in the Western Lake Titicaca Basin, Peru",ARCHAEOLOGY,2007-02-01,Mark Aldenderfer,2008-12-31,Mark Aldenderfer,"Working at the intersection of three disciplines-paleoclimatology, which attempts to understand the causal forces of climate change, fluvial geomorphology, which seeks to understand how landscapes change and evolve under different climatic conditions, and archaeology, which places humans into this dynamic environment and searches for patterns of how humans respond to climatic variability, Dr. Mark Aldenderfer and his colleagues will conduct two seasons of archaeological research in the Rio Ramis drainage of the Lake Titicaca basin of southwestern Peru investigating how agricultural systems in this harsh, high elevation environment developed through time. The project will examine in detail three specific research questions on this general theme: 1) the timing of the origins of plant cultivation and its location; 2) the timing of the origins and the initial scale of raised field/q'ocha agricultural systems; and 3) the resilience of raised field systems to draught and increasingly arid conditions. Within each of these questions, his research team has posed a set of competing hypotheses that can be evaluated with archeological data generated by an intensive program of full-coverage survey, surface collection, and an extensive testing program of sites and landscape features directed by geophysical survey. <br/><br/>One of the most important and exciting features of this project is the close interaction of scholars from different scientific disciplines who have crafted detailed research questions of broad importance and who will work together closely in both the field and laboratory seeking answers to them. The kinds of data to be created by this interaction include a high-resolution, well-dated, record of paleoclimatic change in the western Lake Titicaca basin for the past 12,000 years. The implications of these data go far beyond the Titicaca basin, because they will necessarily involve consideration of regional and global-scale forces that give rise to climatic change. It will also generate new sedimentological and geomorphological data that can be used to create a basin-wide model of fluvial evolution in the context of regional climate change. This model will be valuable as a case study of landscape evolution in a complex, arid, high elevation environment, one that may be extended to similar environments in other regions of the world, such as the Tibetan plateau. Finally, it will provide archaeologists with a fuller understanding of the natural forces that shaped landscape evolution and with new archaeological data that will begin to fill the very serious gaps in our knowledge of the prehistory of the western Lake Titicaca basin on the origins and transformations of agricultural technologies. <br/><br/>Among its broader impacts are its promotion of teaching, training and learning by building new partnerships among universities and disciplines. It will promote the integration of research and education by involving both undergraduate and graduate students in research. Each member of the research team will encourage participating students to work directly with every aspect of the project, enabling them to obtain a richer experience than would be possible by working only within a single discipline. Finally, the problems this project addresses and the data that will be produced are directly relevant to research initiatives sponsored by the National Science Foundation and other granting agencies worldwide that seek to understand both natural climate variability and the human impact of global climatic change using the combined paleoclimatological and archaeological record--goals with direct societal relevance."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Post-Hurricane Participatory GIS Mapping along the Gulf Coast to Assess Community Preparedness and Social Network Connection,"DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI, CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY",2008-09-01,Mark Nichter,2011-02-28,John McMahan,"University of Arizona graduate student Ben McMahan, supervised by Dr. Mark Nichter and Dr. Diane Austin, will undertake research on patterns of communication and networks of mutual post-disaster assistance in two localities on the U.S. gulf coast, one in Louisiana and one in Texas. Both regions were affected by severe acute hurricane events in 2005. The regions also experience chronic risks associated with moderate seasonal storms and long term coastal erosion and environmental degradation. The hurricanes highlighted gaps in national emergency management plans, across multiple scales and contexts. However, while national preparedness capacity is a critical component of effective management, the role that locally and regionally embedded social networks play in community preparedness is also significant, but poorly understood. This project is directed towards filling that gap.<br/><br/>The researcher will combine ethnography and participant observation with participatory GIS mapping and social network analysis to investigate local responses to perceived environmental and climatic risks, as well as how these perceptions cohere or divide local and regional social groupings. The data will address the role that social networks play in mitigating immediate and long-term impacts of disruptions. The data also will permit examination of how network connectivity and historical ties to a community's social and physical landscape affect level of perceived risk and responses to disaster events and the chronic conditions that precede acute crises. Finally, the research will pioneer an integrative methodology that incorporates participatory mapping and social network analyses into qualaitative research, drawing on the strength of the confluence of ethnographic, participatory spatial, and social network data to strengthen understanding of how residents of regions facing endemic risks mobilize around these events.<br/><br/>The research is important in the contribution it will make to theorizing new uses of social network analysis across scales in dynamic situations; to improving national disaster preparedness; and to furthering the education of a graduate student."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Cancer, Citizenship, and Scarcity in the Land of Opportunity",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2010-04-01,Mark Nichter,2012-09-30,Julie Armin,"University of Arizona doctoral student, Julie Armin, supervised by Dr. Mark A. Nichter, will undertake ethnographic research on the lived-experience of cancer treatment for uninsured patients who qualify for state-funded care. Because cancer is a disease dependent upon high-tech medical interventions, it offers a particularly rich locus for examining how the experience of health care is affected by ability to pay. As the United States improves access to cancer screenings through programs that offer free or reduced-cost exams, there is an accompanying need for treatment among low-income and uninsured individuals. This ethnographic study of patients, families, and health care providers will examine the experiences of these new ""medical citizens,"" who make claims on various health care resources, including hospitals, medical experts, lay professionals, charities, and state programs. <br/><br/>The research will be conducted in Tucson, Arizona, a city less than an hour from the United States-Mexico border, with a population that often looks to Mexico for less expensive health care. The researcher will use a combination of ethnographic research methods, including in-depth interviews, structured observations, and participant-observation. The research goals are: 1) to document the experience of financial treatment policies from the individual, household, and health care provider perspectives; 2) to examine the clinical bureaucratic practices that invite or restrict access to health care; and 3) to explore the work done by individuals, families and providers who take responsibility for cancer care, with particular attention to gender. <br/><br/>The research is important because it will contribute to theories that seek to explain why social inequalities persist, even in equality-promoting democracies. The research also will help to illuminate how the work as well as the costs occasioned by serious illness are distributed. In addition, research findings may inform the public policy analyses that seek to determine how policy may both enable and constrain individuals, and possibly contribute to health disparities. Supporting this research also supports the education of a social scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Medical Rumors and Humanitarian Relief Clinic Closures in Ethiopia,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2008-09-01,Mark Nichter,2009-08-31,Lauren Carruth,"In the aftermath of humanitarian crises, numerous people have benefited from antibiotic therapies supplied by international humanitarian relief clinics. Yet when emergency funding dissipates, many of these clinics close, leaving impoverished populations without trusted sources of medication. Preliminary research in rural eastern Ethiopia by Lauren Carruth, a graduate student supervised by Dr. Mark Nichter, suggests that in the wake of relief clinic closures, demand for contraband antibiotics increases, while paradoxically, rumors of bad medicine abound. Although the consumption of non-prescribed antibiotics is common, people may take only a few antibiotics at a time because they fear the local drug supply contains poisonous counterfeit pills. As a result of shortened regimens, even if the medications are genuine, they are likely to be taken inappropriately and ineffectively. This dissertation project asks further: how do relief clinic closures shape local antibiotic practices and informal health economies? And, how are medical risks and medical rumors articulated and acted on within communities, markets, clinics, and international humanitarian relief organizations? <br/><br/>The research will be carried out in the remote Shinile Zone of Ethiopia, a locus of transnational contraband trade, recurrent humanitarian crises, and repeated relief operations. Data will be gathered at multiple sites in the Shinile Zone through participatory mapping, in-depth interviews, structured observations, and participant observation. <br/><br/>This research is important for its potential to improve social science theory regarding the long-term but sometimes hidden consequences of disaster relief. Unregulated pharmaceutical practices and informal health economies are central to healthcare in Ethiopia, but remain absent from studies of humanitarian intervention, medical systems, or disaster. By affecting medical behaviors, fears of bad medicine and clinic closures may importantly shape local epidemiology, the evolution and manifestations of infectious microbes, future responses to pharmaceutical products, and future health interventions. Most urgently, local strategies of managing the risks of bad medicine by inappropriately consuming antibiotic pills may provide an ideal environment for the development of diseases resistant to the only medications available. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."
Dissertation Research: Health and Occupational Status in Reform Era China,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1997-02-15,Mark Nichter,1998-01-31,Mark Nichter,"This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the university of Arizona. The student is examining how Chinese women deal with anxiety brought on by rapid modernization. Through interviewing a random sample of 100 women from a diverse set of occupational status in Yunnan province, the student will test the hypothesis that women with lower socio-economic status experience more anxiety due to uncertainties about employment security. The role of gender discrimination will also be analyzed as it affects women of different social classes. The research will study how these social problems are expressed through psychological symptoms and complaints, and how these symptoms impel people to purchase both traditional and western medicines. Methods include participant observation, formal interviews, the collection of daily health diaries, life histories, and collection of material from the popular media dealing with health, psychological and bodily symptoms. This research is important because like other communist countries undergoing reform, rapid change has been a source of tension in China. This project will advance our understanding of the interplay between job security and status and psychologically-related illnesses. Since rapid development has been shown to negatively impact on women's status in many developing countries, increased understanding of the health implications of status differences will be valuable to planners who are creating programs to ameliorate the problems associated with development."
"Dissertation: Health Care Seeking in Nicaragua: Researching the Interface Between Economics, Cultural Understanding, and Practical Logic",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2002-07-01,Mark Nichter,2004-06-30,Mark Nichter,"Health and disease are experienced within social contexts. For people living in poverty, health care seeking decisions are made in conjunction with considerations of how to allocate scarce resources to meet the needs of multiple household members. Much of the international health literature has focused on sociocultural factors that impact health care seeking. Yet little research has been conducted on the ways that economic factors directly and indirectly constrain or facilitate health care seeking strategies in poor households. The proposed study will examine how sociocultural factors, economics, and social relations articulate in health care and resource decision-making among poor and lower middle income households in Nicaragua, a country with high rates of child morbidity and mortality as well as high rates of maternal mortality. Utilizing participant observation and semi-structured interviews, the researcher, an anthropology graduate student at the University of Arizona, will prospectively follow fifty rural households in a municipality of the department of Masaya over the course of a year. Ethnographic research is needed in local contexts to assess how multiple factors impacting on health seeking articulate during actual illness episodes. In addition to providing doctoral training for a promising woman scientist, the proposed study will help fill the gap in the paucity of ethnographic research into contemporary health issues for Nicaraguans living in poverty, and assess the cross-cultural applicability of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of health care seeking."
"Dissertation Research: Child Illness in Rural Laos: CulturalPerceptions, Caregiver Response and Implications for Child Survival",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1999-04-01,Mark Nichter,2002-03-31,Mark Nichter,"This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Arizona. The student will study infant and child illness in Laos, one of the least developed countries in the world. The research will use ethnographic methods to document the socio-cultural and economic contexts in which caregivers in rural Laos distinguish, categorize, diagnose, and select treatments for childhood illnesses, paying careful attention to seasonal variation. In addition the student will study how informal and formal health providers, including vendors, pharmacists, lay healers and public health workers interpret the illness terms and categories presented by caregivers. Methods include participant-observation in a Laotian rural village over 14 months including a household survey, semi-structured as well as structured interviews with small samples of caregivers, additional interviews with a random sample of 50 caregivers, a formal study of drug stores and village market shops selling medicine and providing advice, and interviews with users of public and private clinics and hospitals.<br/>At present there are almost no qualitative studies of Laotian health behavior. This project will advance our understanding of how poor people in an underdeveloped society seek out and interpret the information available to them to treat illness in young children. This new knowledge will be valuable to health officials in similar less-developed societies in preparing programs to provide care. The project will also advance our understanding of this important region of the world."
Dissertation Research: Alternative Caregivers Among the White Mountain Apache and Their Impact on Child Health,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1999-07-01,Mark Nichter,2002-06-30,Mark Nichter,"9904385<br/>Nichter / Sparks<br/> This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Arizona, studying the role and impact of alternative caregivers (not the child's parents) on the health and well-being of the child. The site of the research is the White Mountain Apache, a society that has epidemiological patterns typical of the developing world. The project will explore the roles of and attitudes towards alternative caregivers in one Apache community, and examine how different levels of knowledge, experience, power and resource to resources influence care provision.<br/>This research is important because most studies of caregivers focus on parents, yet others commonly provide child care in most societies in the world. This research is important because most studies of caregivers focus on parents, yet others commonly provide child care in most societies in the world. This project will provide information on who is actually caring for young children, both when they are healthy ad sick, and also will examine the reasons for and attitudes towards the use of different caregivers. It will assess how effective various alternative caregivers are (or are not) at protecting and promoting children's health. The new knowledge to be created about the positive and negative aspects of care by different caregivers will help policy makers design programs of health education. In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: The Local Production of Global Labor,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2009-09-01,Mark Nichter,2011-08-31,Megan Prescott,"University of Arizona graduate student, Megan Prescott, supervised by Dr. Mark A. Nichter, will undertake research on the political economy of the reproduction of labor in globalized markets. She will focus her research on the reproduction of Filipino nurse labor. The Republic of the Philippines is an appropriate site for this study because it is known for overproducing and exporting nurses, which, when the nurses remit wages home, benefits both the national economy and the nurses' families. Prescott will investigate the processes by which Filipino nurse labor is commodified; the role of culture in the production of nurse labor; the international flows of nurses and remittances; and the role of the state in promoting, sustaining, and managing the Filipino nurse commodity chain. <br/><br/>The researcher will gather data at multiple sites and using multiple methods. She will employ open-ended interviews, key informant interviews with multiple stakeholders, semi-structured interviews with nursing students and nurses in the process of migrating as well as their families, surveys with nursing students at 12 colleges or universities, focus groups on perceptions of migrant nurses and the effect of their migration on families, and participant observation at public events and functions. Text data (field notes, interview transcripts, life histories, narratives, and archival material) will be analyzed thematically using text analysis software and narrative analysis techniques. <br/><br/>The proposed research contributes to social science theory by broadening the scope of global commodity chain analysis to incorporate both women's skilled labor migration and the local contexts and communities within which migration becomes normalized. By focusing on the nurse care commodity chain, in particular, the proposed research will provide a new perspective on the complex processes and impacts of nurse migration that is relevant to nurses, families, and health planners and policymakers. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."
Dissertation Research: A Reconsideration of Child Labor in the Contexts of Household Economics and Community Norms,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2003-04-01,Mark Nichter,2004-03-31,Mark Nichter,"0234019<br/>Nichter / Wind<br/>The international effort to end child labor has sometimes been framed as being an ideological battle between Euro-American universalistic conceptions of child development and human rights on the one hand and the culturally specific beliefs and practices of developing countries on the other. Both agencies of the United Nations and child welfare NGOs have emphasized the negative impact of child labor on the physical, mental, and moral health of children. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist will examine the health of child workers in Mysore, India within the context of household livelihood strategies. The student will study a select group of households for one year to determine whether children's contributions to household income differentially affect their access to health-related resources and to identify and compare how a range of work-related variables are perceived as impacting children's health. Interviews with other community members and the staff of local child welfare NGOs will serve to situate the views and practices of individual households within a broader framework of community norms regarding childhood as a life phase, the human rights of children, and the age and gender- appropriateness of different types of work. <br/>The broader impacts of this research include advancing our understanding of how communities evaluate the risks associated with child labor, an understanding crucial to the internationally recognized short-term goal of quickly removing children from the most hazardous forms of work. It will also offer important insights into household health and economic logic useful to those designing child survival and poverty alleviation programs. In addition to such practical applications, the research will add to recent social science efforts to discover ways in which universalistic concepts of human rights may find culturally acceptable interpretations in diverse settings. The project also contributes to the education of a young social scientist."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: American Women, Competing Information, and the Management of Midlife Risks",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2007-08-01,Mark Nichter,2011-01-31,Mark Nichter,"Graduate student Jennifer Jo Thompson, supervised by Dr. Mark Nichter, takes the contemporary American experience of menopause as a key site for understanding how notions of risk operate in everyday experience, and how human beings use personal experience, and expert and lay resources to manage perceived risks. The researcher will investigate how women in the southwestern United States experience menopause, and how competing information about the risks related to menopause circulating in science, the media, and the popular press influences women's menopause management strategies. To generate data for this study, the researcher will use multiple ethnographic methods including interviews and focus groups with perimenopausal women, interviews with healthcare providers, participant observation at menopause-related educational and information sessions, and careful monitoring of the representations of menopause in science, media, and popular press. Data will be analyzed using qualitative open-coding and re-coding techniques to identify themes and thematic patterns. <br/><br/>By focusing on how notions of risk operate not on the level of grand theory, but as a part of everyday experience, this research contributes to the understanding of how people negotiate information and risk discourses in their daily lives, the way these discourses are inscribed on bodies, and the way bodily practices are shaped in response. From an applied perspective, this study provides a model based on an exemplar case study for investigating patient decision-making in a pluralistic healthcare environment where the public is increasingly exposed to ambiguous or contradictory information about the risks and benefits of mainstream and alternative therapies. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student."
Doctoral Dissertation: Respiratory Health and the Experience of Modernity in Two South Indian Communities,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2000-09-01,Mark Nichter,2002-08-31,Mark Nichter,"Abstract 0001494<br/><br/>This project will investigate the relationship between recent socioeconomic and environmental changes in South India and changing respiratory health/disease patterns; specifically, the prevalence of asthma has increased dramatically in this region. The research will focus on Indians' explanatory models of this disease and its presumed causes. It will examine how the experience of, and explanations for, asthma influence health-care seeking and management in a setting of medical pluralism, and how these vary by class, caste, and gender. It will specifically analyze how local models/perceptions may be contributing to poor management of the disease. Two south Indian communities that have experienced different kinds of socioeconomic and environmental change-- an industrial town and a rural village -- will be compared. Methods include structured interviews with samples of households, the elicitation of factors causing asthma, an analysis of medications utilized, and a health services study of local pharmacies and drug vendors. This research will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between economic/environmental change and deteriorating respiratory health in many parts of the industrialized, developing world."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Positional Behavior and Limb Use in Cebus, Alouatta, and Ateles",Biological Anthropology,2003-02-15,Mary Morbeck,2004-01-31,Mary Morbeck,"Studies of positional behavior (locomotion and posture) are central to key issues in biological anthropology including primate origins and arboreal adaptations, hominoid climbing, and hominid bipedalism. The study of locomotion and posture provides critical information concerning ecological, anatomical and evolutionary relationships in living species, a comparative framework for interpretation of the fossil record, and as an educational tool for conservation and ecological planning. This research examines the ontogeny (the life history of an individual) of positional behavior and details of limb and prehensile-tail use in three New World primate species (Ateles geoffroyi, Alouatta palliata, and Cebus capucinus) inhabiting a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica.<br/> During the course of growth and development, individuals face different challenges in exploiting their environment. Ontogenetic data allow assessment of behavioral and morphological changes as they occur and developmental constraints on positional behavior among closely-related species. While ontogeny is critical to our understanding of positional behavior, there are no field studies that assess its effects on New World primates. White-faced capuchins (Cebus), black handed spider monkeys (Ateles), and mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta) will be examined at La Suerte Biological Research Station in Costa Rica. Behavioral observations in conjunction with digital video recording will be used to document positional strategies during infancy, juvenescence, and adulthood to address the following objectives. First, this research will provide a comprehensive, systematic, and quantified description of expressed behavior, functional morphology, and ecological context of three prehensile-tailed species. Second, data on juvenile and adult positional strategies will provide information on how growth and development may influence feeding and foraging strategy, social behavior, and ultimately survival during the juvenile period. Third, because the prehensile tail has evolved independently in the subfamily Atelinae (Alouatta, Ateles, Brachyteles, and Lagothrix) and Cebus, this study will allow comparison of the prehensile tail as a shared-derived feature in two more closely-related species (Ateles and Alouatta), and as an analogous feature in the more distantly- related Cebus. Closely-related howler and spider monkeys are biobehavioral variations on the ateline theme, that is, large-bodied, long-tailed New World primates with extensive gripping capabilities. Capuchin monkeys, also with prehensile abilities of the tail, differ in body size and tail anatomy (and evolutionary history). <br/> This project will contribute a comprehensive, systematic, and quantified description of expressed behavior and ecological context in three New World primates inhabiting the same rainforest. By focusing on questions of ontogenetic differences in positional behavior, this study examines the degree to which adult-like patterns of locomotion and posture develop in primate ontogeny and how patterns may differ within and between age and sex categories. Finally, the results of this research will be used in the conservation planning and maintenance of the rainforest surrounding La Suerte Biological Research Station. As part of these efforts, results will contribute to educational programs in the surrounding community and in the United States."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Subsistence Change in the Middle to Upper Paleolithic in Southern Greece: Klissoura Cave 1 and its Context within the Mediterranean Basin,ARCHAEOLOGY,2008-08-15,Mary Stiner,2010-07-31,Britt Starkovich,"In a dissertation research project conducted under the supervision of Dr. Mary Stiner, Britt Starkovich will study changes in human hunting strategies from the Middle through Upper Paleolithic (about 80,000 to 15,000 years ago) at Klissoura Cave 1 in Peloponnese, Greece. Klissoura Cave 1 contains the longest, most complete Pleistocene archaeological sequence that has been excavated to date in Greece. The Greek Paleolithic has thus far been understood from a small handful of sites, with much variation in the quality of archaeological deposits and subsequent excavations and publications. Klissoura Cave 1 is well-excavated and contains many intact cultural features and strata. Starkovichs in-depth analysis of the animal remains from the site would greatly enhance our knowledge about Paleolithic subsistence strategies in this part of the Mediterranean. <br/><br/>Research on long-scale change in human diets is important in understanding adaptations that allowed our species to survive and flourish in a world of unpredictable climates and nutritional uncertainty. Much can be learned about the behaviors of past foragers based on their hunting decisions. Changes in subsistence over a long temporal sequence such as that at Klissoura can shed light on larger demographic, social or environmental changes. These shifts can be detected from trends in prey species representation and the body parts of large prey animals that were transported from a kill site to a home base, and the ages of the animals hunted. In considering changes in species representation, it is important to look at both small and large game. Shifts in small game use are often a more sensitive indicator of human dietary change, and possible related changes in human population densities. This project examines these indicators of changing human subsistence behavior, with special attention to small game, as well as potential non-human factors, such as carnivore damage or weathering, that may have degraded some of the archaeological materials and biased the assemblage. <br/><br/>Beyond research questions of interest to social scientists, this project will have broader impacts in both the public and scientific realms. The Greek people have a long tradition of being interested in their past, but they have very little exposure to time periods before the temples and shrines of Classical Greece were built. The directors of the Klissoura project have reached an agreement with the Nafplio Museum, eastern Peloponnese, to create a public exhibition on the Paleolithic occupations of Peloponnese based on the findings from Klissoura Cave. Starkovich's results on the animal remains will be a significant part of in the display. The museum exhibition on Klissoura Cave will provide Greek people and the many international visitors to the museum with a deeper understanding about past. From a scientific standpoint, the Klissoura project is a large-scale collaborative effort, involving an international team from Greece, Poland, Belgium, Spain, and the United States, conducting interdisciplinary research on all aspects of the site. International collaborations are critical to scientific endeavors, because they allow researchers from different backgrounds and paradigms to interact and learn from one another and to have access to sites and technologies that would otherwise be unavailable without the larger group effort. NSF funding of this project will facilitate the training of a graduate student and forward the working relationships formed on the Klissoura project well into the future."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Human Ecological Integration In Beringia,DDRI Archaeology,2015-04-01,Mary Stiner,2017-03-31,Francois Lanoe,"Ph.D. candidate Franois Lanoï, of the University of Arizona, will study the long-term ecological interactions between societies of hunter-gatherers and populations of large terrestrial mammals. The human species has interacted with its environment by means of hunting and gathering life-ways for over 99% of its history. Previous scholarship has described the consequences of some of these interactions, including possible resource extinction caused by overharvesting. The archaeological and paleontological records are particularly well placed to describe and provide interpretations for these ecological dynamics because they generally extend over very long periods of time. Often, however, these issues are studied separately by archaeologists and paleoecologists without real integration of their respective research questions; as a result, perspectives specific to human ecology have so far been under-emphasized. Within this broader context this project will focus on the trophic ecology of hunter-gatherers, how they fit in the trophic networks (""food webs"") among other large predators and what their role and impact on the whole ecosystem is. This project is innovative in that it will implement an interdisciplinary methodological and theoretical framework in order to address novel aspects of the sustainable integration of hunter-gatherer societies in ecosystems over the long-term. It will allow a variety of professionals (archaeologists, paleoecologists, theoretical ecologists) to build upon its results.<br/>This project will focus on modeling the modes of resource partitioning between humans and other large predators, and their respective impacts on communities of large mammals. It will be conducted in Alaska and Yukon, where societies of hunter-gatherers entered North America for the first time at the end of the Ice Age, between 14,000 and 8,000 years ago. The colonization of this region corresponded to one of the first settlements of the arctic and generally coincided with major turnover in both vegetation and mammalian species, including megafauna extinction. This project will contribute to the knowledge of human settlement and subsistence of central Alaska through the excavation and faunal analysis of selected archaeological sites. In addition, using a combination of paleontological and chemical methods, this research will document feeding interactions among large mammals at the end of the Ice Age. This interdisciplinary dataset will then be used to model and understand how human settlers exploited resources, and how their economical choices impacted the ecosystem as a whole."
"Predator-Prey Dynamics, Site Formation Processes & the Roots of the Forager-Herder Socioeconomic Transition at Asikli Hoyuk, Turkey",ARCHAEOLOGY,2009-09-01,Mary Stiner,2013-12-31,Mary Stiner,"This project investigates the roots of the forager-producer socioeconomic transition at the site of Asikli Houk in Central Anatolia (Turkey). This mound site is located in the northern arc of the ""Fertile Crescent"", the Old World region that gave rise to the first farming and herding cultures. The basal cultural layers of the mound exceed 8200 cal BC, and they present a rare opportunity to examine the ecological and social substrates from which village economies arose out of a hunter-gatherer heritage. Led by Prof. Mary Stiner from the University of Arizona, the study will last 3 years and is nested within a larger international excavation and conservation effort overseen by Prof. M. Ozbasaran of Istanbul University, Turkey. <br/><br/>The research program integrates zooarchaeological, geoarchaeological (including micromorphological), and radiocarbon dating methods to address a common set of questions. Of great interest is the ecological and behavioral background of incipient sheep and goat domestication as hypothesized strategies for enhancing meat security and responses to social competition. The zooarchaeological part of the study considers possible evidence for harvesting pressure on wild animal populations (sheep, goats, deer & wild cattle), changes in dietary breadth, intensified carcass processing such as grease extraction, and possible evidence for corraling of animals on site. The econimic evidence will be used as the standard against which anomalous (less explicitly practical) patterns of animal use can be guaged, such as those that may relate to social display or conspicuous consumption. <br/><br/>Another goal of the study is to understand how some or all of the consumer behaviors listed above may have contributed to shifts in trophic level and energy capture from the environment at the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the Holocene. In addition to dating the 2 m of cultural deposits, an analyses of biomineralized Celtis endocarps will be conducted to obtain background information on local precipitation during the periods of occupation. <br/><br/>The geoarchaeological component of the research program is crucial for determining the functions of mudbrick structures on the site and the kinds of activities conducted on prepared floor and natural ground surfaces. Evidence for animal captivity, hypothesized for wild sheep and goat, is expected to include microscopic dung remnants inside enclosures. Preliminary tests indicate that traces of dung are present in the younger layers of the site, and the contents of the earliest layers are unknown. A pilot geological sampling study will also be conducted in the surrounding region in anticipation of future strontium isotope work on ungulate teeth. The latter effort is important to establishing the geographic areas where animals were hunted as opposed to those which may have been held captive on site. <br/><br/>The proposed research is interdisciplinary, and its components are bound together by close conceptual and technical links. The issues of collections access, sample suitability, and available infrastructure have been worked-out, greatly increasing the chances for successful completion of the study. The research builds on existing approaches but is also distinct in its emphasis on an integrated model of social and economic valuations of meat resources. In addition to its scientific contributions, the research program contributes substantively to the development of synergistic professional exchanges between Turkish and American researchers, on the excavation and through two workshops to be held at the University of Arizona. <br/><br/>The research will generate unique data on one of the most remarkable periods in human evolution. The forager-producer transition marks a profound restructuring of human socioeconomics, demographic potential, and relationships with nature. The A&#351;&#305;kl&#305; H_yôk stratigraphic series is sufficiently detailed and continuous to examine the conditions from which domestic ungulates and ownership evolved. Because the sedimentary layers and faunas targeted by this study push the evolutionary chronology of Central Anatolia back into a poorly known period, the results will enhance the value of existing data sets in the region. Not all benefits to come from this study concern the past: any success in understanding the underlying processes of the forager-producer transition can also expose important lessons in conservation and management for the present and future of humans in natural systems."
The Paleolithic Faunas of Hayonim Cave (Israel): An Integrated Plan for Research and Education on Hominid Ecology,ARCHAEOLOGY,1995-07-01,Mary Stiner,2004-06-30,Mary Stiner,"Stiner This award under the NSF Faculty Early Career Development competition will provide five years of support to Dr. Mary Stiner to further her paleoanthropological research in Israel, to permit her to develop a laboratory at the University of Arizona and to allow the incorporation students into her project. The funding will permit her and a student to travel to Israel each year to conduct preliminary analyses of faunal materials recovered through archaeological excavation. A sample will be shipped to the Arizona facility where they will be subjected to extensive examination. Funds will also permit the purchase of necessary research and training equipment and laboratory supplies and will provide student support. Dr. Stiner's study centers on the analysis of recently excavated faunas from Hayonim Cave in Israel. The work investigates the human foraging niche in the Near East during the late Middle through early Upper Pleistocene geologic periods, a question fundamental to understanding the origins of modern humans in this region. The long faunal sequence at Hayonim is important because it fills a unique and crucial gap in our knowledge about the emergence of anatomically modern humans. During this period between ca. 200,000 to 50,000 years ago two different kinds of humans were present in the Near East. One of these was directly ancestral to modern day peoples and archaeologists wish to understand their behavior and how they adapted to their changing environment. Through the analysis of faunal remains, it will be possible to reconstruct environmental change over time and to gain insight into the ways in which people utilized the range of animal resources available to them. This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on human-environment interactions. It will provide insight into the emergence of modern behaviors, support the research and teaching career of a promising young scientist and assist in student training."
Investigating the Neo-lithic Transition,ARCHAEOLOGY,2014-02-01,Mary Stiner,2017-01-31,Mary Stiner,"The fundamental goal of this research is to provide insight into the process of human - environmental interaction, and how human and natural systems, each influence the other. The early Neo-lithic period was perhaps the greatest transition in human record--a time of dramatic change in which people moved from a foraging lifestyle to a farming-based one, thus altering both the course of human history and our place in environmental systems. Although we recognize the significance of the Neo-lithic period, it remains poorly documented. Improved documentation of this important time period of human change may help us better understand our present day rapid technical change.<br/><br/>With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Mary Stiner and an international team of archaeologists will investigate the very beginnings of sheep domestication and herding practices in the Middle East. The research focuses on the social and economic consequences of early sheep management and related changes to the human-built environment. The study will be conducted at one of the first settlements in central Turkey, the pre-pottery Neolithic site of A__kl_ H_yôk (transl. ankle-bone hill), dating to the interval of 10,300-11,000 years ago. Using the theoretical framework of human-animal co-evolution, this study considers how iterative problem-solving altered the conditions of selection for both humans and sheep across roughly 50 human generations. The investigation will be accomplished through an integrated study of animal bones, geological traces and botanical (phytolith) remains from the site. <br/><br/>The transitional period between foraging and food-producing societies is poorly known, in stark contrast to a wealth of information on the later Neolithic. Prior research at A__kl_ H_yôk by the PI and colleagues has demonstrated that sheep were held captive on site. Managing sheep in this way brought on both advantages and challenges to these people. Such close human-animal proximity is expected to have provoked novel strategies of waste and pest management, alterations in architecture and community layout, and reorganization of social institutions surrounding the exploitation of these animals. This study will provide critical information on the day-to-day contexts of animal management in its formative stages, and how this initial history of close interaction between humans and animals set society on a new path of socioeconomic change. The investigation will also shed light on the ""selection rules"" that ultimately produced domesticated forms of sheep. <br/><br/>The research is innovative in its implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to test ideas drawn in a developmental evolutionary framework. The study will last 3 years (2014-2017), and NSF funds will contribute to excavation and material recovery costs and support a wide range of specialized laboratory studies in radiocarbon dating, sediment micromorphology, phytolith analysis, and zooarchaeology. NSF funds will also cover travel and per diem costs for the PI, collaborators and UA graduate students, and provide short-term focused training opportunities for Turkish PhD students in archaeological science. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research center on the surprising relations between small, cumulative innovations in animal management and their long-term effects on fundamental qualities of human society. Nearly every aspect of modern human existence is touched in some way by our dependence upon domestic plants and animals. Humans' concerted use and manipulation of a select few species (including sheep) has altered the course of history and greatly affected humans place in natural systems. As profound as some of these effects have been, scientists and a keenly interested public still do not understand how the processes were set in motion. The archaeology of A__kl_ H_yôk is sufficiently detailed and continuous to serve as a laboratory for wedding our understandings of ecological and social evolutionary processes behind the story of animal domestication. The research meanwhile addresses larger needs for integrative approaches in domestication research and the development of skilled, creative scientists for the next generation."
NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Beyond Acorns and Small Seeds: A Diachronic Functional Analysis of Mortuary Associated Ground Stone from the San Francisco Bay Area,ARCHAEOLOGY,2010-09-15,Mary Stiner,2012-08-31,Tammy Buonasera,"Under the supervision of Dr. Mary C. Stiner, Tammy Buonasera will study changes in the functions of ground stone artifacts from male and female graves from the San Francisco Bay Area of California spanning the mid- to late Holocene (ca. 6000 B.P. to 200 B.P.). Because ground stone milling tools are essential for intensive food processing, they have long played an important role in archaeological interpretations of resource use and the organization of female labor. However, not all ground stone artifacts were used for food processing; some ground stone artifacts had other purposes such as the preparation of ritual or medicinal substances, pigment processing, hide working, the production of beads and ornaments, use as vessels, or as wealth and status markers. This study will employ three different techniques to evaluate the breadth of, and changes in, the functions of ground stone tools during the mid- to late Holocene in central California: Use-wear analysis (both microscopic and macroscopic), absorbed organic residue analysis, and morphological analysis.<br/><br/>Some researchers have proposed that an increasingly rigid and pronounced sexual division of labor developed among complex hunter-gatherers in central and southern California. Others have argued that increasing social stratification should lead to a decreased emphasis on a division of labor based on gender. Differential representation of certain forms of ground stone artifacts (some with very high manufacturing costs) and evidence for uses related to food processing, manufacturing, or ritual activities will be the basis for evaluating these hypotheses. Of particular interest is the relation to women's status with decreasing mobility and increasing social complexity. <br/><br/>In addition to improving knowledge of long-term social changes among Native California societies, this research may make broader contributions to understanding developmental trajectories of a sexual division of labor. Central California is among the few areas worldwide where a level of political complexity typically associated with horticultural or agricultural societies is known to have developed among hunters and gatherers. As such, it offers a unique economic context in which to study the effects of a developing hierarchy on men's and women's activities and status.<br/><br/>This research will provide training opportunities for one or more graduate students and will foster collaboration between several different institutions (the University of Arizona, the Institute for Integrated Research in Materials, Environments, and Society at CSU Long Beach, The San Diego Archaeological Center, and CSU San Jose). Results of ground stone analyses will be shared with the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, and will be more widely disseminated through publication in appropriate scholarly journals and through presentations at regional and international meetings. Finally, photomicrographs of use-wear will be posted on a free archaeological data sharing website to help improve the transparency and reliability of use-wear interpretations."
Dissertation Research: Small Game Use and Human Economic and Demographic Change at the Transition to Agriculture in the Levant,ARCHAEOLOGY,1999-02-01,Mary Stiner,2000-01-31,Mary Stiner,"Under the direction of Dr. Mary Stiner, MS Natalie Munro will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. The goal of her project is to understand the processes which led to the domestication of plants and animals in the Near East and to this end she will analyze small faunal remains recovered during the excavation of three archaeological sites. All are attributable to the Natufian culture (ca. 13,000 to 10,000 years ago). This is the time period which immediately preceded the appearance of agriculture and pastoralism in the region. The Natufians were the last people to subsist on hunted and gathered foods and many archaeologists believe that a detailed understanding of their subsistence practices will shed light on the major revolution which followed. Previous analyses by Stiner and Munro on Natufian material from the site of Hayonim cave has indicated a surprisingly heavy reliance on small animals, especially birds and hares, species which are difficult to hunt, which reproduce rapidly and therefore can withstand heavy predation pressure. This finding is unusual because Natufian peoples are generally viewed as subsistence specialists who depended heavily on gazelle for food. Munro postulates that the Natufian shift to small and less desirable small animals likely reflects pressure on and depletion of food resources, likely the result of human population increase. Were such the case, it would bolster ""push"" arguments which postulate that human societies where pushed to utilize a broad range of resources and develop effective techniques to obtain low ranked foods. Such a strategy would logically lead in the direction of domestication.<br/><br/>MS Munro will analyze the remaining Natufian fauna from Hayonim Cave as well as from two other Natufian sites to determine whether the preliminary pattern is in fact correct. She will examine bones to ascertain which result from human activity and the extent to which the sample is biased by natural post depositional destruction. She will reconstruct butchering patterns and species specific mortality profiles. With the incorporation of published biological data she will be able to determine how humans utilized and relied on these species and how in turn these populations were affected. This project will not only contribute to understanding the ""Neolithic Revolution"" but also assist in training a promising young scientist."
"Zooarchaeological Study of Pan-Mediterranean Trends in Paleolithic Diet, Predator-Prey Dynamics & Ecology",ARCHAEOLOGY,2004-06-01,Mary Stiner,2008-11-30,Mary Stiner,"The Mediterranean Sea forms of the hub of three great continental masses, Africa, Europe, and Asia, and thus figures prominently in discussions of human origins, population expansions, and culture change. The Mediterranean Basin provides a crucial laboratory for this kind of research on account of its unique ecology, with many endemic taxa enriched over time by periodic incursions of species from adjacent Afro-Arabian, Irano-Turanian, and Pontic biogeographic regions. Some of the earliest evidence for resource intensification among humans occurs in the eastern end of the basin during the Late Pleistocene. <br/><br/>Dr. Stiner's NSF-funded research examines variation in human subsistence and animal community structure across the Mediterranean Basin from 400,000+ to 8,000 years ago in four distinct ecogeographic quadrants. The project is principally a zooarchaeological study, but it includes stable carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotope analyses of key ungulate taxa in order to track gross variation in vegetation structure, humidity, and temperature through space and time. The proposed research raises questions about Paleolithic subsistence and society in the Mediterranean Basin at larger temporal and spatial scales than could be addressed previously. At issue are the geography and chronology of key transitions in human predatory niches across distinct areas of the region, particularly in terms of prey age selection, dietary breadth, and the intensity of carcass processing efforts. If variation in the prey species hunted by hunters cannot be explained by climate-driving changes in animal community structure, it likely indicates changes in human predatory niche. The research undertakes comparisons of prey species abundance and associations in archaeofaunas across Mediterranean regions and through time, using established criteria for categorizing prey. Predator-prey simulation modeling provides specific expectations in the investigation of hunting pressure and sustainability that can be related changes in human population densities. Climate-driven restructuring of animal communities will be evaluated from independent stable isotope data obtained from tooth enamel carbonate and bone collagen, and from age/size distortion in the population structures of slow-growing small animals and ungulates. <br/><br/>Most enlightening with respect to human subsistence evolution are ""niche boundary shifts"" and how these transitions cluster in time. Prior research has shown, for example, that the development of the large game hunting niche as defined by prime-age-dominant mortality patterns dates to the onset of the Middle Paleolithic period or before. Far more difficult to explain are the downward shifts in trophic level that characterized later humans. The focus on meat exploitation is an obvious necessity for any zooarchaeological project, but there is more reason for it than just this. Meat is one of the very few sources of complete protein in nature, and its rarity sharpens humans' interest in obtaining it in large packages. Large animals are available sporadically, although sharing can help to remedy the unevenness in the supply. The optimal rate of meat consumption is in small but regular doses, however, and small game can represent reliable, continuous sources in some circumstances. Any subsistence behaviors that enhance the predictability of critical nutrients-such as increasing the nutritional yield and/or more efficient harvesting of resilient (very productive) small game-can improve childhood survivorship and thereby swell a population without a change in birthrate. The human ""footprint"" on Late Pleistocene ecosystems is difficult to deny in many world regions yet it has been equally difficult to separate from independent paleoenvironmental changes. Distinguishing these effects can only be accomplished through careful control of the key variables. Towards this end, geography is held constant in four study areas of the Mediterranean Basin in order to make sense of variation in Paleolithic game use. The project responds to unique opportunities to close significant gaps in each Mediterranean archaeofaunal series and to understand the causes of subsistence change there. The scale at which this research integrates zooarchaeological and stable isotope data has never before been attempted and will provide valuable reference points for scholars of human dietary change in the Paleolithic and for wild species that eventually came under domestication. <br/><br/>The outcomes of the research are relevant to global questions about the relation between human demography, predatory niche, and animal community changes. The new assemblages targeted by this study will also greatly enhance the value of existing large data sets and help clarify the timing and geographic centers of rapid population growth during the later Pleistocene. To date, most information on human population history has been obtained from comparisons of modern human genetic diversity, which on the whole suggest several demographic pulses originating from western Asia and/or Africa. Time is the most difficult variable to control in these studies, because the biological clocks inferred from gene mutation rates are notoriously inaccurate. By contrast, human demographic pulses evidenced by the zooarchaeological record can be dated by radiometric techniques and their geographic positions compared. <br/><br/>The research program fosters international collaboration in four host countries, where Stiner and students will work directly with local archaeologists and other scientists. A significant proportion of this grant will fund cost-effective graduate student research in the context of cross-disciplinary science. The research also addresses a larger need for integrative approaches with an evolutionary time depth for documenting the long-term place of people in ecosystems, a plea underscored recently by the scientists hosted by the NSF-funded Santa Fe Institute conference in May 2003 on ""The Robustness of Coupled Natural and Human Systems""."
Ritual Formation Processes at Bronze Age Mt. Lykaion,ARCHAEOLOGY,2011-08-01,Mary Voyatzis,2014-07-31,David Romano,"With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Mary Voyatzis and David Gilman Romano, together with a multinational interdisciplinary team, will analyze the evidence for early cult and ritual practice at the ash altar of Zeus at Mt. Lykaion in Arcadia, Greece. Central to the project is the investigation of the ways in which systems of belief serve to anchor and provide social stability in traditional societies over extended periods of time. It is clear, looking at societies and nations in the world today that identities are in significant measure forged around ideologies, both religions and other, which incorporate a society?s core values and which provide both cohesiveness and a base for decision making. To be effective over the long run such core values must be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances and archaeology has the potential to examine how such belief systems function over extended periods of time. The Mt. Lykaion site assumes significance in this context. <br/><br/>Archaeological research at the site indicates that ritual offerings took place over a period likely of more than one thousand years and the stratified layers are composed of burnt animal bone and other remains. Over the course of two field seasons, trenches have been placed through the deposit and this award provides funds to study of the formation processes and chronology of the ash altar and its contents, integrating various scientific techniques such as carbon-14 dating, ceramic analyses, geoarchaeology, the study of animal bones (zooarchaeology), chemical residue analysis and paleoethnobotany. One of the many research objectives is to evaluate the zooarchaeological, ethnobotanical and ceramic evidence for continuity and change in ritual activities and other types of human behaviors from the Final Neolithic through the Archaic periods. <br/><br/>An important aspect of the project includes field training of undergraduate and graduate archaeology students. The NSF grant will support a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Arizona for Dr. Britt Starkovitch, who will institute and develop laboratory protocols for the pre-treatment of calcined bone samples. Dr. Starkovich's work will enable the NSF-Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory to radiocarbon date calcined bone samples from Mt. Lykaion and from other projects in the future. <br/><br/>A proposed (privately funded) research center in Megalopolis, near Mt. Lykaion, will create a permanent facility in the Peloponnese to enhance and promote international research for students and scholars in a variety of fields. Broader benefits include the creation of a new archaeology program for underserved high school students at Mt. Lykaion, and importantly, the establishment of a 550 square kilometer Parrhasian Heritage Park in the area of Mt. Lykaion. The park will create hiking trails linking the ancient sanctuaries and cities within it, and include signage relating to the antiquities and the natural flora, and fauna. The chronological and other results of the project will be detailed on park signs located near the mountain summit."
Dissertation Research: The Genetics of Malarial Selection in Sub-Saharan Africa,Biological Anthropology,2002-08-01,Michael Hammer,2004-07-31,Michael Hammer,"The nearly complete sequence of the human genome has greatly enhanced our understanding of human genetics. This single reference sequence, however, is not able to capture the extent and nature of human genetic variation. Efforts are now are shifting to describing patterns of variation across populations and regions of the genome particularly as it relates to human genetic diseases. Disease association studies are proving useful in identifying individuals at risk for certain diseases; however, much of human genomic variation is not related to disease. Patterns of variation can be shaped by natural selection (e.g. on variants in disease-related genes) and historical processes (e.g., migration and genetic drift). Natural selection affects variation associated with a specific gene or set of genes. Additionally, regions associated with a given disease comprise a relatively small portion of the entire genome. Historical processes, on the other hand, affect the entire genome. While a clearer picture of human evolutionary history is emerging, it is not known to what extent historical processes have shaped patterns of variation at disease genes. This study will assess the role of historical processes in shaping variation at genes conferring resistance to the infectious disease, malaria.<br/>Each year malaria affects ~500 million people and kills ~2 million with the vast majority of these deaths occurring in Africa. Alternate forms (alleles) of the beta-globin and G6PD genes are known to confer resistance to malaria and these alleles are found at high frequencies in populations residing in malarial environments. Interestingly the same alleles that confer resistance to malaria can also cause inherited diseases (i.e., sickle cell anemia, G6PD deficiency). The question is what is the relative role of natural selection and historical processes in shaping patterns of variation in and around these genes? To address this the reseachers will perform a two-way controlled comparison of patterns of DNA sequence variation in these two genes in four African populations with different susceptibility to malaria as a selective agent. Two of the four populations (the Luo and Dogon) occupy regions of sub-Saharan Africa that are strongly impacted by malaria, and two populations (the San and Southeastern Bantus) live outside malaria areas. Additionally, to dissect the role of historical processes in shaping variation in these populations, DNA sequences of two other gene regions that are not affected by malaria will be determined. One of these regions is on the tip of chromosome 16 (16p13.3) and the other is within an intron of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene (Dmd intron 44) on the X chromosome. This experimental design should provide a sound hypothesis-testing framework for distinguishing those forces that act a single gene from those that affect the whole genome. Furthermore, collaborations with researchers at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and at the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as the involvement of students from the University of Arizona and Pima Community College, will enhance the intellectual and training environment of this research."
Collaborative Research: A Novel Genetic Database to Test Models of Human Origins,"ARCHAEOLOGY, Biological Anthropology, HUMAN ORIG: MOVING IN NEW DIR",2004-09-01,Michael Hammer,2010-08-31,Michael Hammer,"The human genome holds clues to the mystery of human origins. With the recent completion of the first draft of the human genome sequence scientists are now in a position to examine patterns of variation across the entire genome in multiple human populations. Such an undertaking will facilitate an understanding of events that took place tens of thousands of years ago, and the better design of studies to map genes involved in human disease today. <br/><br/>In this project, scientists from different fields within genetics (both theoretical and empirical population genetics) will gather new data and design novel analytical methods to answer long-standing questions in human evolution. One focus of this research is on the evolutionary relationships of ""archaic"" human groups (such as the Neanderthals in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia) to modern humans. Did archaic forms make any contribution to the contemporary human gene pool, or were Neanderthals and H. erectus completely replaced (without interbreeding) by modern humans as they expanded out of Africa within the last 100 thousand years? Did the ancestors of present day groups make the transition to modern form in a small, isolated part of Africa, or over a broader geographic range with genetic contributions from divergent populations. Another focus of this research is on human population growth. Although our current population size is more than 6 billion, the long-term average population size was probably substantially less than 1 million. When did human populations begin to expand dramatically in size? Was this growth associated with a particular event in human history, such as the advent of language or the invention of agriculture?<br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to address these and related topics by building a public database of DNA sequences from contemporary human populations, and by developing the computational tools necessary for the analysis of the data. DNA sequences will be otabined from 90 regions of the genome in representatives of six geographically diverse populations (e.g., three from sub-Saharan Africa and three from Eurasia), as well as representatives of humans closest living relatives, the great apes. Statistical and computational methods will be developed for rigorously testing the predictions of alternative hypotheses. The results of this project will be disseminated to a larger audience both through a public website and through an interdisciplinary symposium on human origins that will be organized in the fourth year. <br/><br/>This research has several broader impacts. First, it will encourage debate and interaction among researchers from genetics, paleontology, archaeology, and historical linguistics. Second, the research will integrate research, teaching, and community outreach. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows will be trained in a combination of theoretical and experimental skills. Programs are in place at both the University of Arizona and the University of Southern California for identifying promising candidates from underrepresented minorities and these students will be recruited to participate in the project. While training a new generation of anthropological geneticists this project will facilitate novel discoveries in human origins research."
"Collaborative Research on the Genetic Effects of Culture: Y Chromosome DNA, MtDNA, and Patrilineal Kinship in the Dogon of Mali",Biological Anthropology,2005-08-01,Michael Hammer,2007-07-31,Michael Hammer,"Kinship is a universal feature of human social life and, in the United States, genealogy is the second most popular hobby. Yet despite this fascination with kinship, a fundamental mystery has been neglected: Do people adopt kinship practices that serve the interests of their genes? Or does culture define kinship practices causing genetic underpinnings to become obscured? This study will explore the congruence between the cultural and genetic spheres of kinship and, in so doing, shed light on the broader relationship between biology and culture. It is a collaborative venture that combines the expertise of a human population geneticist with that of an anthropologist. This interdisciplinary research will introduce state of the art molecular technology to ethnographic field studies and provide a rich ethnographic data set to permit new questions to be asked using genetic sequence data. The study focuses on the Dogon, a traditional millet farming people of Mali, West Africa. The Dogon are ideal for this research because they employ a variety of cultural practices that appear to be reproductively motivated. This research will test the hypothesis that these cultural rules serve the genetic interests of those who enforce them and that they lead to a close mapping of culture onto biology. The study will also test alternative hypotheses about the basis for human cooperation. This objective is significant because it will be one of the first analyses of helping behavior in a human population that uses data on genetic relatedness from DNA sequencing. <br/>The broader impacts of the study include the training of American and Malian students in genetic techniques and quantitative fieldwork methods. Medical residents will gain experience in a developing country and share their expertise with a rural African health facility. The results will be disseminated in scientific journals, genetic databases, and a specialized monograph."

This project focuses on the non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome in Asian populations to shed light on ancient migrations within Asia and movements to the rest of the world. The investigators will continue Y chromosome surveys in 14 native Siberian populations and perform the first detailed study of genetic variation in 12 indigenous Mongolian groups. Y chromosome data will also be collected from 14 West-Central Asian, East Asian, and North-Central Chinese populations. In combination with similar global data, this information will be used to (1) construct Y chromosome haplotypes; (2) measure levels of intra- and inter-group components of variation; (3) establish genetic relationships among these populations from the perspective of male lineages; (4) build a phylogenetic tree that shows how contemporary Y haplotypes evolved from ancestral ones; (5) estimate the time to the most recent common ancestral Y chromosome and the ages of individual mutations in the haplotype tree; and (6) perform statistical tests to identify associations between haplotypes and geography. The combined data will be used to address a number of hypotheses regarding the chronology of the initial peopling of northern Asia, the nature of its ancient human populations, the origins and migration patterns from Asia to Europe and the New World, and an Asian back-to-Africa migration."
The Genetic Basis of Adaptation to Climatic Stress in Siberian Indigenous Populations,"Biological Anthropology, ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES",2013-04-01,Michael Hammer,2016-03-31,Tatiana Karafet,"Our species originated in Africa, and subsequently dispersed to all other continents except Antarctica. During this dispersal, human populations were exposed to a variety of climates that differed substantially from those in their African homeland. Nowhere do these climatic conditions differ more dramatically than in the far northern reaches of Siberia. Indeed, humans represent the only primate species other than the Japanese macaque that has adapted to boreal conditions?where temperatures remain far below freezing for more than half the year?pointing to intense selection pressures that likely drove the enhancement of physiological processes that generate and conserve heat. However, despite the fact that humans have lived in cold climates for millennia, we still know very little about how this process of adaptation occurred at the genetic level. <br/><br/>The native populations of Siberia provide the best opportunity to investigate the genetic basis of cold resistance given their long-term residence in some of the coldest climates on earth. While much of northern Europe was under ice throughout the last glacial period, Siberia remained relatively ice free, and archaeological evidence suggests that people inhabited this region for more than 40,000 years. The successful long-term settlement of this area by humans undoubtedly required multiple adaptations to deal with the extended severe cold stress, dramatic variation in photoperiod, and limited and highly variable food resources. This project will gather genome-wide polymorphism data from 15 populations that live across a large area of Siberia, from regions of southern Siberia to the northernmost settlements on the Taymyr peninsula within the Arctic Circle. Patterns of variation in these cold-adapted populations will be compared with those from Central and East Asian populations that live in warmer climates. Particular attention will be paid to genomic regions containing genes that have been previously implicated in cold adaptation, or that function in known pathways connected to energy metabolism or cold-adapted traits. The combination of dense genetic data, wide geographic population coverage, and several powerful methods for detecting the signatures of natural selection will offer the most comprehensive picture of genetic adaptation to cold in humans to date."
Testing Models of Genetic and Linguistic Change in the Caucasus Mountains,Biological Anthropology,2010-09-15,Michael Hammer,2014-08-31,Tatiana Karafet,"Since the 1980's, researchers have observed correlations between genes, language families, and geography at continental and sub-continental scales. But all such patterns must originate from processes occurring at the community level. The goal of this project is to examine fine-scale patterns of genetic diversity to investigate how historical processes produce genetic, linguistic and cultural change. Specifically, this proposal will gather genome-wide polymorphism data from many of the populations representing different language families in the Caucasus Mountains. The ethnolinguistic groups inhabiting the highlands of the Caucasus speak Nakh-Daghestan (ND) languages that show a very high degree of differentiation given their geographic proximity. The Caucasus region is also of particular interest because it represents one of the first to be settled by expanding farming populations from the Near East, and there is no scientific evidence pointing to subsequent major migrations into the highlands. Thus, the great age and diversification of its populations may well reflect a long-term entrenchment after an initial colonization of a Mesolithic population. In contrast, nearby lowland populations have a history of contact with a variety of populations speaking non-ND languages. The resulting diversity provides a unique opportunity to investigate comparative histories, highlighting the interactive processes that produce a variety of types of genetic and linguistic differentiation. <br/><br/>In collaboration with the Russian Academy of Sciences, this interdisciplinary project will produce a new body of high-density genetic data that will become publicly available, and develop new statistical tools that will be made freely available to the research community. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained, and collaborators in Russia will share the results of the work through local television broadcasts in the Caucasus. For the local people of the Caucasus, knowledge of genetic ancestry is highly valued, as is an increasing scientific appreciation of their linguistic and cultural diversity."
U.S.-Russia-Mongolia Joint Collaborative Research: Comparative Framework for North Asian Genetic Diversity,"Biological Anthropology, ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES, CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE PROGR",2002-09-15,Michael Hammer,2006-08-31,Tatiana Karafet,"This research will use human genomic variation patterns as a tool for testing hypotheses concerning the early peopling of North Asia and the Americas and for assessing the relative effects of sex-specific demographic processes and natural selection in shaping North Asian genetic diversity. Within genetics, the study of lineages that are inherited paternally, maternally or biparentally can offer different insights into the origins and global dispersals of Homo sapiens. The genetic analyses will be applied to a panel of 16 males from each of 6 Siberian populations. Comparisons of intra-specific patterns of variation within and among human populations, and with levels of divergence between humans and great apes at these loci, will enable tests of the effects of natural selection and potential differences in male and female effective population sizes. Informative polymorphisms discovered in this Siberian ascertainment panel will be genotyped in a larger set of North Asian samples to allow further tests of the associations between linguistic, geographic, and genetic variation and the effects of genetic drift, migration, and admixture on North Asian populations. These results will be used to aid in constructing more realistic colonization models involving different stages for the early peopling of the Americas.<br/><br/>Results from this research will enhance our understanding of the evolutionary history of our species. Reconstructing the patterns and processes of human evolution in Asia is of interest because the the earliest dispersal routes of anatomically modern humans out of Africa are not well understood from the archaeological and paleontological records. Further, this region is the origin for subsequent migrations to Japan, Siberia, and the Americas. The 31 native ethnic groups of Siberia, 14 of which are available for this project, offer significant opportunities to examine the evolutionary forces that may have acted on early modern human populations. Until very recently many native Siberian groups retained traditional subsistence economies and lifeways that may have reflected a pre-Neolithic population structure. North Asian populations, especially those adapted to boreal climates in the northernmost regions inhabited by humans, are genetically subdivided, and genetic drift has played a key role in shaping patterns of variation in Siberia. Furthermore, the demographic history of Siberian populations has led to an unusually strong association between language and genetic variation. The proposed research is a first attempt to develop a comparative genetic framework using data obtained from the same set of samples.<br/><br/>The proposed research will directly address three major challenges that now face anthropological geneticists. The multiple locus approach to be taken here will help to understand: (1) which portions of the human genome are variable; (2) how genomic and evolutionary processes have interacted to generate observed patterns of diversity; and (3) what the relative roles of each of these forces have been over different periods of time and in different populations. In addition to having a fascinating evolutionary history, Native Siberian populations represent an ideal model system within which to address these timely issues."
"Dissertation Research: Apportionment of African Genetic Diversity Based on Mitochondrial DNA, Y Chromosome, and X Chromosome Data",Biological Anthropology,2004-07-15,Michael Hammer,2006-06-30,Michael Hammer,"Paleontological, archaeological, and genetic data all point to Africa as the continent where anatomically modern humans originated. However, it is still not known whether modern humans evolved in a small, isolated deme, or over a broader geographic area encompassing many African populations. While detailed analyses of the structure of African genetic variation should help to answer this question, there are very few studies at the nucleotide level other than those involving mtDNA. Here we propose to obtain DNA sequence data from multiple loci to characterize patterns of African genetic variability and to assess the degree of subdivision among modern African populations. <br/><br/>The general research design is to examine DNA sequence variation at four unlinked, neutrally evolving loci in five African populations (n =200): the Khoisan, Southeast Bantu, Bakola, Dogon, and Dinka. Sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome, and two genes on the X chromosome will be compared. By examining four loci for which the reconstruction of gene trees is possible, we will be in a position to infer the time to the most recent common ancestor and mutational ages throughout the tree diagrams, and the degree (and age) of population structure at different times in human evolution. <br/><br/>The proposed research will provide the first nucleotide-level estimate of African population subdivision based on multiple loci, and should lead to deeper insights into the effective population sizes of ancestral populations and the evolutionary processes that were involved during the transition to anatomically modern human form. The proposed project would involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a member of the Sudanese refugee community in Tucson. Finally, this research will help to expand public knowledge of African population history and indirectly benefit populations that are underrepresented in current medical research."
The X Chromosome and Human Origins,Biological Anthropology,1999-07-15,Michael Nachman,2003-06-30,Michael Hammer,"The primary objective of the proposed research is to study the origin of modern humans using patterns of DNA sequence variation at four genes experiencing low to high amounts of recombination on the X chromosome. Within the last ten years, studies of mitochondrial, Y chromosome, and autosomal genes have been used to make inferences about long-term effective population size, age of lineages, location of ancestral lineages, pattern and timing of major migrations, population expansions, admixtures, and bottlenecks, and the genetic affinities of different ethnic groups. However, recent studies in molecular population genetics have revealed that many genes in the genome are influenced by selection at linked sites and thus do not serve as useful markers for tracking population processes. Genes in regions of the genome experiencing the highest rates of recombination are likely to be the best candidates for evaluating several important parameters of interest in models of human origins, including coalescence time and effective population size.<br/><br/>The proposed research will explicitly evaluate a continuum of models from the Recent African Replacement model to the Multiregional Evolution model using data from the X chromosome. In particular, this research will (1) accurately estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor and the effective population size for individual geographic regions and for the human species as a whole, (2) reconstruct relationships of different geographic groups from patterns of genetic variation, and (3) provide a further test of the hypothesis that natural selection is acting to reduce genetic variability in genomic regions experiencing low rates of recombination. Variation will be assayed by sequencing non-coding DNA in each of two high-recombination genes and two low-recombination genes in a global sample of 40 humans and representatives of the great apes (Pan troglodytes and Pongo pygmaeus). For the two low-recombination genes, an additional 350 individuals representing many major ethnic groups will be surveyed using a mutation detection method (DHPLC) and DNA sequencing.<br/><br/>This proposal represents a collaborative effort that combines expertise in human evolution and population genetics. Global surveys of X chromosome variation will provide a critical framework for testing hypotheses on the origins of anatomically modern human populations and their subsequent dispersals throughout the world. The data generated in this research will also provide one of the most detailed pictures of the<br/>structure of genetic variation at the nucleotide level in a large worldwide sample and will help determine the relative importance of different forces (mutation, drift, selection, and recombination) in shaping patterns of DNA sequence variation in our species."
Dissertation Research: Nucleotide Variability at G6pd and the Signature of Malarial Selection in Humans,Biological Anthropology,2002-08-01,Michael Nachman,2004-07-31,Michael Nachman,"Malaria is a major cause of illness and mortality in humans. Every year nearly 500 million people suffer from malaria and upward of 2 million people die from this tropical parasitic disease. Some human populations that have historically lived in regions with high levels of malaria infections carry genetic resistance factors to the disease. Among these genetic resistance factors are some variants (alleles) of the gene coding for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Thus G6pd is subject to positive natural selection in some human populations in malarious areas. Few examples of positive natural selection are recognized at the molecular level in humans and the effect of selection on the genome is not yet well understood. To understand the effect of selection on DNA nucleotide variability and to identify a signature of positive natural selection at the molecular level, this research will describe patterns of nucleotide variability within and around the gene coding for G6PD in humans. Specifically, this research will describe patterns of nucleotide variability within G6pd, and at ten other neighboring genes spanning over 2 Mb around G6pd in two distinct human populations from Africa and Iraq that bear independently arisen polymorphisms at G6pd that confer resistance to malaria. A random sample of 50 individuals from the Luo of Kenya, and 50 Iraqi Jews will be used in the study to (i) characterize the signature of selection on G6pd, (ii) characterize variation at loci linked to G6pd, (iii) estimate the age of the selected alleles based on patterns of nucleotide variability, and (iv) compare G6pd systems in Africa and Iraq to distinguish between deterministic factors (e.g. natural selection) and stochastic factors (e.g. genetic drift) that are responsible for shaping the observed nucleotide patterns.<br/>Patterns of nucleotide variability found in this study at G6pd that are due to selection by malaria will shed light on the evolutionary history of the association between Plasmodium falciparum (the primary human malaria parasite) and humans, a topic that is still not clearly understood. Furthermore, the ability to recognize the signature of positive natural selection in general at the molecular level in humans will be useful to possibly identify additional human genes that are subject to selection by various infectious diseases and ecological factors."
DNA Variability and Natural Selection in House Mice and Humans,"POPULATION DYNAMICS, Biological Anthropology",1997-02-01,Michael Nachman,2001-01-31,Michael Nachman,"9628942 Nachman A central goal of population genetics is to understand the forces that determine the amount and distribution of genetic variation in natural populations of organisms. The primary goal of this project is to look for evidence of natural selection in patterns of DNA sequence variation in populations of mice and humans. The second objective is to determine the relative importance of two forms of selection: the spread of new beneficial mutations, and the elimination of deleterious mutations from populations. Recent improvements in molecular techniques and statistical analyses will be used to sequence and analyze patterns of DNA variation, in 20 genes in house mice (Mus domesticus) and 10 genes in humans, as well as in two species of mice (Mus spretus and Mus caroli) closely related to the house mouse and in two primates (Orangutan and Common chimpanzee) closely related to humans. Genes from the X chromosome and from several other chromosomes will be sequenced. An important aim of this work is to determine the relationship between the amount of genetic variation at each gene and the rate of recombination (the amount of genetic mixing between the two copies of a gene in individuals). Work in fruit flies and preliminary work in mice suggests that genes with more recombination are more variable. This has important implications; for example, conservation biologists interested in estimating genetic variability in a species will need to sample genes with both high and low recombination rates. This project will provide insight into the processes affecting the amount and distribution of genetic variation in nature. This is essential not only for conservation biology but also for understanding the genetic basis of evolutionary change in any organism. Moreover, the work on humans will document the amount of genetic variability within and between different regions of the world and will provide important clues to the origins and migrations of modern humans."
Dissertation Research: The Ethnoarchaeology of Andean Pastoralism,ARCHAEOLOGY,1992-11-01,Michael Schiffer,1995-08-31,Axel Nielson,"Under the direction of Dr. Michael Schiffer, Mr. Axel Nielson will conduct field research to collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will spend 18 months working in the community of Cerrillos located in the highlands of Bolivia. Cerrillos is one of the few communities of the Bolivian Altiplano that still practices a purely pastorial economy that has characterized the Andean highlands for thousands of years. Inhabitants still maintain a long-distance caravan trade using llamas as pack animals. Mr. Axel Nielson will conduct an ""ethnoarchaeological"" study: that is he will examine present practices in an attempt to understand the past. While it is known that pastoralism was practiced prehistorically in many parts of the world, it is not well understood what role this way of life played in the development of complex civilizations. In part this is because archaeologists don't understand how to interpret the material remains they recover. It is not clear what kind of archaeological ""signals"" a pastoral way of life leaves on the ground. Mr. Nielson research will visit all households in the community and select several for intensive study. He will participate in caravan trips and in the main non-daily activities carried out throughout the annual cycle. He will survey pastures and water resources and conduct an in-depth analysis of surface refuse distributions at selected settlements. This research is important because it will provide scientists with the tools to interpret a little-understood aspect of the past. A major road construction program is planned for this region and the behaviors Mr. Nielson plans to observe will soon disappear. The project will also assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Mobility and Farmers: Adaptive Diversity in the American Southwest,ARCHAEOLOGY,1989-12-01,Michael Schiffer,1991-11-30,Michael Schiffer,"Under the direction of Dr. E. Charles Adams, Ms. Lisa Young will analyze materials from two archaeological sites located within Homolovi Ruins State Park, near Winslow, Arizona. These will provide the basis for her doctoral dissertation. The sites, a pithouse village labeled HP-36 and a nearby pueblo Homolovi II, span the period between ca. 700 A.D. - 1350 A.D. and document the development of a Native American settled way of life in the southwestern United States. Analyses will be conducted on the abundant faunal and floral remains recovered from the sites. Detailed examination of the associated lithic assemblages will provide insight into stone tool use. The data, taken together, will allow Ms. Young to determine when within this period the shift to a settled lifestyle occurred. Archaeologists working in the Southwest have long believed that the construction of semi-underground dwellings, given the amount of labor involved, indicate a sedentary way of life and have used such dwellings as an indicator of an agricultural mode of subsistence and sign of increased cultural complexity. Recently, however, other archaeologists have suggested that such is not the case and the builders of such houses may still follow a hunting and gathering way of life. Through examination of lithic, faunal, and floral remains Ms. Young will directly evaluate this hypothesis. This research is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of how complex societies such as our own emerge. It will also aid in the development of analytic techniques which can be applied to a variety of sites in many parts of the world. The project will increase our understanding of Native American prehistory and also assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist."

The technique that will be established through this project is called archaeomagnetic dating, and it uses preserved records of changes in the position of the earth's magnetic north pole to date burned, clay-rich archaeological features such as cooking hearths, pottery kilns, or the walls and floors of burned structures. This technique has been used successfully over the past 30 years to date sites throughout the U.S. Southwest, Europe and Japan, and this project aims to make the dating technique possible in the U.S. Southeast as well.<br/><br/>Archaeomagnetic dating depends on 1) the fact that the earth's magnetic north pole drifts around the geographic rotation axis on the order of decades, and 2) the fact that burned, clay-rich archaeological features, such as cooking hearths, accurately record the position of the magnetic north pole at the time they were last fired (e.g., the last time a cooking hearth was used). When enough archaeomagnetic directional data are collected from well-dated archaeological features (e.g., a cooking hearth that also yielded a radiocarbon date) in a given region, a master record of archaeomagnetic change can be constructed in the form of a regional reference curve. However, due to local variations in the magnetic field, each reference curve is only valid over a 2000-km wide region. Therefore, the goal of this project is to construct the reference curve for the Southeast, thus making archaeomagnetic dating possible in this region.<br/><br/>This project is important because it will provide archaeologists working in the U.S. Southeast with a means of establishing, verifying, and refining the temporal frameworks needed to address basic anthropological questions about past cultures. By furnishing researchers with tighter temporal control over the archaeological data, the regional archaeomagnetic curve developed through this project will allow archaeologists to examine the play of sociocultural processes across time and space and at a variety of scales, ranging from the sub-site level (e.g., between structures) to the pan-continent level (e.g., between the Tennessee River Valley and the Phoenix Basin). In short, the completion of the Southeast archaeomagnetic curve will provide researchers with an independent dating method that not only complements existing chronometric tools, but, when used in conjunction with those tools will allow for more temporally refined treatments of prehistoric cultural processes. This award will also assist in training a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Mind the Gap: The Dynamics and Work of Aging and Caring at Home,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2009-08-15,Mimi Nichter,2012-01-31,Lauren Penney,"Doctoral student Lauren Penney (University of Arizona), under the supervision of Dr. Mimi Nichter, will investigate how the processes at work in aging and home care are affected by such factors as cultural conceptions of aging and health, socio-economic status, and the broader political economy. Her research will focus on home health agencies, direct care workers, and aging older adults and their families as they negotiate the requirements of Medicare-reimbursed home health care. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out in southern Arizona. The research will employ multiple methods, including in-depth interviews, job shadowing (of health care workers), participant observation, focus groups, and surveys. <br/>She will examine the relationship between Medicare eligibility requirements, views of users of home health care, and the direct care workers' senses of their own professional and moral obligations. The study will explore how older adults (and their families) manage gaps that may emerge between (1) their experience of home as private and a site of the provision of health care, (2) the cultural background and life experiences of themselves and their direct care providers, (3) how older adults are represented in relation to cultural ideals, and (4) their social and health care needs and what is available in the long-term care system. <br/><br/>The research will contribute to social science theory of the relationship between formal institutions and the human experience of the life cycle. At this historical juncture, as a new administration takes office during a time of economic crisis, entitlement programs such as Medicare have been targeted for reform. This research will provide a meticulous, in-depth analysis how how the system works at multiple levels of scale and from the perspectives of multiple stakeholder. This will provide policy makers a comprehensive and culturally sensitive analysis of the workings of the current long term care system."
"Systematic, Intensive Surface-Survey at Sisupalgarh: First-Millennium Urbanism and Economic in India",ARCHAEOLOGY,1999-08-01,Monica Smith,2003-10-31,Monica Smith,"With National Science Foundation support Dr. Monica Smith will conduct two seasons of archaeological fieldwork at the site of Sisupalgarh, located in the state of Orissa, India. Occupied during the early historic period, this city covers 130 hectares and is enclosed by a large brick and mud rampart with eight gateways. Buildings were constructed in both stone as well as brick and monolithic pillars testify to the monumental architecture present. Prior work has indicated a rich and varied artifact repertoire including metal objects (nails, rings, projectile points, sickles) ornaments, coins, beads of ivory and stone as well as abundant ceramics. Four distinct periods spanning the 300 BC to 350 AD period of occupation have been identified. With NSF support Dr. Smith and her colleagues will conduct a systematic archaeological surface survey of the site to provide data on economic, social and political activities. A detailed topographic map will be prepared and a grid of 50 x 50 meter squares established. This will provide the base for a systematic non-aligned random collection. The data gathered through the two-year field season will be analyzed using GIS to examine how different production and consumption indicators are spatially distributed. On this basis it will be possible to determine the range of activities, commercial and domestic, and how these were integrated into broader economic, social and political systems.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to evaluate the economic and social configuration of a city under conditions of increasing sociopolitical complexity. Unlike regions of the world in which the emergence of cities is closely linked to broader state level political organization, the Indian subcontinent presents an archaeological record of cities without states. Sisupalgarh and other Indian cities thrived in a period in which political organization was relatively weak and urban zones appear to have been the largest consistent unit of territorial integration in which political leaders invested any surplus in highly visible landscape modifications such as fortifications and monumental architecture. This project will provide insight into how these unusual entities functioned and how they developed and changed over time. The project is also important because it will assist the career development of a promising young scientist."
Storage Improvement and Stabilization of Archaeological Textiles,SYSTEMATIC ANTHROPOLOGICAL COL,1989-07-15,Nancy Odegaard,1992-06-30,G. Michael Jacobs,"The Arizona State Museum, part of the University of Arizona at Tucson, houses an excellent archaeological textile collection which includes approximately 1200 textiles and textile fragments. A 1987 conservation condition survey identified ca. 300 items which required improved storage conditions and 26 items in need of immediate conservation. With NSF support both goals will be achieved. The project includes examination, photodocumentation, and historical research on the materials. They will be carefully removed from damaging backings, mounts, and supports. Protective archival mounts and pads will be constructed, and the textiles will be stored in a custom-built oversize cabinet which affords protection from fluctuating environments and deleterious particulates. An experienced textile conservator and conservation specialist will be hired for this purpose and a well-equipped conservation laboratory in the Museum made available to these personnel. The textile materials derive from archaeological contexts both in the American Southwest and the coast of Peru. It is rare for such fragile remains to be preserved, but in both areas the extremely dry climates provided protected environments. Many scientists who have worked with these materials have attested to their importance. In prehistoric societies textiles served many functions, and through analysis of them, scientists can gain insight into many aspects of prehistoric society. Analyses provide information on status differences and mechanisms of production and distribution. Examination of dyes and weaving techniques reveals information on technological advances and innovation. Ironically, archaeological materials are often best protected if left in the ground. If museum storage conditions are inadequate, objects which have survived for thousands of years unattended can rapidly decompose. This project is important because it will assist in the preservation of archaeologically significant specimens and make them available to a wide range of researchers."
"Storage Improvement, Conservation Treatment and Documentation Upgrade of Archaeological Perishable Material",SYSTEMATIC ANTHROPOLOGICAL COL,1995-09-15,Nancy Odegaard,1998-02-28,G. Michael Jacobs,"Odegaard With National Science Foundation support, Nancy Odegaard and her colleagues will conduct a program to improve the conservation of and access to perishable archaeological artifacts excavated from a number of sites in the American Southwest. This collection consists of an estimated 21,500 artifacts and ethnobotanical lots. Based on a conservation survey, approximately 18% require improved housing; many others require major or minor conservation treatment. To remedy these problems, the team will undertake necessary conservation, improve storage of materials and consolidate and organize associated documentation. The related computerized database will be updated and a user's guide developed. The archaeology of the United States Southwest is important for several reasons. First, this region saw the rise of complex societies which in prehistoric times linked communities with roads which stretched across large expanses of deserts, which constructed multistory buildings which housed hundreds of individuals and which devised ways to survive in a harsh and unpredictable desert environment. Secondly, because of the dry conditions, perishable organic materials are often well preserved and these provide insights which are rare in archaeological situations. For example it is often possible to reconstruct local environmental conditions and then determine the subsistence strategies which human groups took to adapt and respond. The perishable organic materials at the Arizona State Museum are an endangered and valuable archaeological resource. With NSF support, they will be properly conserved and made more available for scientific research."
Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant: Youth in Debate with the West: Citizenship Within and Beyond the European Classroom,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2011-03-01,Norma Mendoza-Denton,2012-08-31,Maisa Taha,"Graduate student Maisa Taha (University of Arizona), supervised by Dr. Norma Mendoza-Denton, will do research in southeast Spain, where an intensive greenhouse agriculture boom has attracted immigrants from Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and above all, Muslim North Africa. This research will address the processes of incorporation and inclusion of immigrant populations resulting from globalization and transnational processes presently occurring. Specifically it will focus on the interactions of Spanish and first-generation immigrant youth in high school classes designed to promote democratic values and ethical living (part of the EU's so-called ""Citizenship"" curricula). <br/><br/>The researcher will use participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and audio/video recordings to document how immigrant and Spanish students examine their own multicultural existences with each other and with teachers. The research will take place at high schools in three towns with distinct demographic profiles, with the objectives of (a) assessing the prevalence of East-versus-West arguments around ideals of freedom, equality, autonomy, and secularism taught in the Citizenship classes; (b) documenting political and cultural debates inside and outside of classrooms; and (c) historically contextualizing current debates about immigrant inclusion, education, and citizenship at the local, national, and pan-European levels. <br/><br/>There are numerous broader impacts from this research. The project is significant because it will deepen understanding of how publicly-schooled youth in highly diverse settings engage with civic and ethical education intended to promote ""unity-in-diversity"" across the entire EU. Given the racial, linguistic, religious, and cultural differences that have segregated communities in southeast Spain, the findings from this study will also contribute to education policy and curriculum development while offering a first-hand view of an upcoming, newly multicultural generation of citizens learning to handle social inclusion and democratic action. Such results will prove relevant to policy makers, educators, community organizers and scholars around the world who seek ways of understanding how democracy and pluralism can grow in tandem, particularly when it comes to marginalized and often stigmatized, non-Western groups."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Technological Change in Southwestern Asia: Metallurgical Production Styles and Social Values during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages,ARCHAEOLOGY,2009-05-15,Pamela Vandiver,2011-04-30,Lesley Frame,"In the Laboratory for Cultural Materials at the University of Arizona, under the direction of Pamela Vandiver, Lesley Frame will examine evidence for some of the earliest copper production in the world (early 5th millennium BCE) to understand technological choices made by prehistoric craftspeople. Three sites on the Iranian Plateau (Tal-i Iblis in the South, and Seh Gabi and Godin Tepe in the North) have yielded archaeological evidence for smelting copper. The Plateau region is unique in the persistent use of crucibles (shallow bowl-like vessels) for over two millennia for converting copper ore to metal for despite the presence of more efficient technologies (e.g. the furnace) in the surrounding lowlands and nearby coastal regions.<br/><br/>In order to study the reasons for the persistent use of crucibles, and the earliest metallurgy on the Iranian Plateau in general, one must first develop a dynamic view of metallurgical technology on the plateau. This dynamic view must consider metal production in different locations (with access to different raw materials including ore, fuel, and clay), and it must consider different scales of production (in workshop and residential settings), and changes in social values, trade networks, demand for metal goods, and access to other craftspeople, and therefore other technological processes. This project examines early metal production on the Iranian Plateau by focusing on (1) both published data and new results generated by this project from large-scale production areas, (2) data from trade and urban centers that exhibit evidence of small-scale, ""cottage-level"" metal production and working as well as a wide range of metal artifacts, and (3) the technological choices and technological changes exhibited at these sites that occur with other, non-metal, materials on the Plateau.<br/><br/>This project will contribute significantly to our understandings of the early development of metal technology in the Iranian highlands. In addition, the detailed study of the important highland Iranian sites included in this project, which have been largely neglected since their initial excavation over 30 years ago, will shed new light on the practices of and interactions between Chalcolithic and Bronze Age communities. Furthermore, the methodology and use of social technology theories makes this project anthropologically robust as well as analytically detailed.<br/><br/>Further, the number of scholars studying the archaeometallurgy of Iran is small, but diverse. The broader impacts of this project include contributions to an ongoing dialogue within this international group of German, British, Iranian, Canadian, and American researchers regarding the state of the field and the interpretation of our collective data. The project will also contribute to undergraduate education at the University of Arizona. The experimental archaeological casting is being incorporated as a demonstration and interactive experiment for upper-level undergraduates in Materials Science and Engineering. These classes are designed to help students understand the relationships between processing and properties of materials, and how technology has changed over the past 30,000 years."
Dissertation Research: Resource and Residence at an AncientMaya Community,ARCHAEOLOGY,1989-06-01,Patrick Culbert,1990-11-30,Laura Levi,"This grant permits Ms. Laura Levi, under the direction of Dr. Patrick Culbert, to conduct her doctoral dissertation research. She will carry out archaeological work at the Mayan site of San Estevan which is located in the lowland tropics of Belize. Prior work by Ms. Levi and others has revealed the presence of a large series of prehistoric house mounds which date to the height of Mayan development. Ms. Levi will conduct a survey of the site to determine mound locations. She will also collect surface ceramics and undertake limited archaeological excavation. Through use of aerial photographs, microenvironmental zones will be defined and the size and distribution of mounds related to this ecological variable. Ms. Levi postulates that prehistoric lowland Mayan farming is based of the detailed knowledge of slightly different microenvironmental zones and that success involved use of more than one zone. She also argues that decision making took place on a family or household level, and that household success and size is directly related to the ability to farm more than one zone. Through comparison of house mound location (in relation to microenvironment) and size, it is possible to test this hypothesis. This research has great practical value. The Middle American tropical lowlands today permit human occupation at only low population densities. The ancient Maya lived in the same environments in much larger numbers and inhabited regions for very long periods of time. Understanding of Mayan agricultural practices may permit more effective contemporary use of such regions. This project will also further the career development of a very promising young scientist."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Traders and Farmers: The Multi-Settlement Community Organization in the Rio Sonora Region, Mexico",ARCHAEOLOGY,2012-05-01,Paul Fish,2013-12-31,Matthew Pailes,"Under the direction of Dr. Paul Fish, Mr. Matthew Pailes will conduct research for his doctoral dissertation. He will investigate community structure and household exchange patterns in northeastern Sonora, Mexico, which developed between AD 900 and 1600. In this region, the interests of households to maintain subsistence autonomy, in conflict with the need to form larger groups for security and other reasons, led to unique organizational patterns. This research is broadly important because it provides insight into how groups and alliances form in traditional small scale societies and how they are maintained or altered over substantial periods of time.<br/><br/>Sixteenth century accounts of Spanish explorers describe hierarchically organized territorial communities in northeastern Sonora. Previous researchers argued defensive needs and elite control of long distance exchange were the foundation of community organization. A pilot study in the Moctezuma Valley provided data contrary to this reconstruction. Communities appear to be small, relatively unorganized, and integrated through local exchange. The insights from this pilot study are the basis for two research questions: 1) Were communities actually composed of small settlement groups lacking in inter- or intra-community political differentiation? and if so, 2) Did the small scale of communities encourage households to maximize local settlement ties as a means of risk mitigation? To answer these questions Mr Pailes will intensively map and excavate a sample of structures at the largest sites in three settlement communities. This will provide data on internal settlement organization and test whether the settlements held structurally equivalent roles in their respective communities. A second line of research will employ microscopic techniques to investigate the provenance of ceramic artifacts. Provenance data determined from petrography will indicate the extent and variability in household economic ties to other communities and will serve as a proxy for inferring social relationships. The project also will refine the poor chronology of this region through ceramic seriation and thermoluminescence dating of pot sherds. <br/><br/>This proposed project has broader impacts for several reasons. It will provide detailed information on an understudied region between the better-known U.S. Southwest and Mesoamerica and contribute significantly to reconstructions of pan-regional political trajectories. Simply refining the chronology in northeastern Sonora will have significant impacts. Community outreach is a focus of the planned work. To foster a sense of connectivity to the past, local residents will be employed during excavation. The project will invite local students and residents to visit the excavations. These efforts will inform local residents of the value of archaeological remains and discourage their unneeded destruction. A Mexican collaborator will be involved with the project to encourage international cooperation and interest in shared research questions. The project will provide experience to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arizona.<br/><br/>Data will be disseminated through a variety of means. Traditional scholarly journal articles and formal conference presentations will be produced for Spanish and English audiences. M. Pailes will give several public lectures in the United States and will lead site tours to the area for avocational and other interested groups. Copies of the dissertation will be provided to Mexican government offices and institutions."
"Dissertation Research: Hohokam Ceramic Production, Distribution and Consumption",ARCHAEOLOGY,1994-04-01,Paul Fish,1996-03-31,Paul Fish,"9400239 Fish Under the direction of Dr. Paul Fish, Ms. Karen Harry will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will employ both neutron activation analysis and petrographic techniques to analyze potsherds collected at two Hohokam archaeological sites located in Arizona. She will use field surveys to locate clay sources and determine the trace element compositions of these as well. On this basis it will be possible to relate ceramic product back to raw material source. It will also be possible to examine the distribution of ceramic types within each of the two sites and between them. Ms. Harry can then use these data to reconstruct intra and intersettlement production, distribution and consumption patterns and thus gain insight into economic and social organization. The Marana and Los Robles settlement communities which form the basis for this study were occupied by Hohokam peoples during the early Classic period and date to between A.D. 1050-1300. The Hohokam are well known archaeologically for the large irrigation systems they constructed which permitted agriculture in low rainfall areas of the Arizona desert. They also occupied large sites with impressive platform mounds. These attest to the aggregation of large numbers of people and some form of centralized hierarchical control. Archaeologists wish to understand how such centralized societies develop and postulate that control and organization of trade may play a central role. Ms. Harry will examine this question. Because ceramics played a vital role in both subsistence and ritual, they provide an excellent insight into the social and economic lives of these communities. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide information of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on U.S. prehistory and assist in the training of a promising young scientist. ***"
"Collaborative Research: Power and Economy at the Marana Mound Site: Structure of an Early Classic Center Near Tucson, Arizona",ARCHAEOLOGY,2000-08-01,Paul Fish,2004-11-30,Suzanne Fish,"With National Science Foundation support Drs. Paul and Suzanne Fish and James Bayman will conduct archaeological research at the Marana Mound site, located in the Tucson Basin of Arizona. Associated with the prehistoric Hohokam culture, the site dates to the early Classic Period (1150-1300 AD) and was occupied for approximately 100 years. The mound site was constructed at a central geographical point and represents the top level within a broader three tier hierarchical community. It is approximately 1.5 km. long and .5 km wide. Because it is not situated in a favorable riverine or upland locale, it received water from a 10 kilometer long canal constructed from the Santa Cruz River. Composed of compounds of ca. 5500 square meters with up to 20 enclosed structures, the site population probably ranged between 500 and 750 people. In a number of ways the site is unique from its smaller counterparts. Not only is it the largest but it also is the only one which contained significant numbers of distant trade items. A neutron activation sourcing study suggests that it, along with two other large sites, participated in a common exchange network that differed from acquisition patterns and ceramic sources in other community settlements. Assemblages recovered from house floors are distinctive in the number and variety of items represented and the high frequency of artifacts linked to craft production and personal ornamentation. Thus there is a marked concentration of imported items and manufacturing activities at the mound site compared to other settlements. While the Marana Mound is distinguished from its smaller counterparts, there appears however to be minimal internal differentiation within the site itself and this finding runs contra to archaeological preconceptions. As site hierarchies emerge and class structure becomes apparent, normally internal differention within individual communities occurs as well. Based on limited evidence from Marana Mound however such did not happen. <br/><br/>The team will examine potential differentiation at the site through a four-tiered sampling design focusing on compound clusters, compounds, rooms and trash mounds. Evidence for differential advantage and competitive strategies will be sought in four realms: 1. Access to and consumption of exotic or high value items; 2. Economic activities beyond ordinary subsistence production and consumption; 3. Involvement in external exchange; and 4. Participation in communal or integrative observances as signaled by ritually-related items. This research will provide insight into the paths which led to the rise of complex societies. It shed new light on North American prehistory and provide data of interest to many archaeologists."
Doctoral Dissertation Research: El Ombligo Archaeology,ARCHAEOLOGY,1995-12-01,Paul Fish,1997-11-30,Paul Fish,"Under the direction of Dr. Paul Fish, Mr. John Carpenter will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze mortuary remains which were excavated many years ago near Guasave, Sinalo in Northern Mexico. The mound, which was originally believed to be an habitation, proved in fact to be a burial mound which contained almost 200 human skeletons and associated grave goods. These materials, which are housed in the American Museum of Natural History, have never been fully analyzed. Mr. Carpenter will conduct a detailed examination and in particular will focus on the variation among individuals. On this basis it will be possible to determine the extent to which the society itself was socially stratified and the degree of social complexity it achieved. These materials are very poorly dated and radiocarbon determinations will be made to determine exact chronological placement. Extensive archaeological research has provided detailed information on the rise of complex prehistoric cultural entities in the U.S. Southwest and massive ruins such a Chaco Canyon in New Mexico attest to the level of social organization attained. Likewise much is known about the civilizations of Central Mexico. However the area between these two centers are poorly known from an archaeological perspective and archaeologists wish to understand whether this region served as a bridge between the North and South, whether it was a hinterland or whether it followed an independent cultural trajectory. The research by Mr. Carpenter will provide insight into this question. This work is important for several reasons. It will shed new light into the development of New World civilization. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Macroregional Interactions at the Onavas Valley, Sonora, Mexico, during the late Pre-Hispanic Period",ARCHAEOLOGY,2004-05-15,Paul Fish,2005-04-30,Paul Fish,"Under the supervision of Dr. Paul R. Fish Mr.. Emiliano Gallaga Murrieta will collect archaeological data recording pre-Hispanic (A.D. 1000-1550) material remains in the Onavas Valley in the Middle Yaqui River area in southern Sonora, Mexico. Geographical and physical conditions make the Yaqui River a natural causeway between three well-established archaeological regions: Mesoamerica, the U.S. Southwest, and Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. While researchers have debated at great length about the connections during pre-Hispanic times between Mesoamerica and the U.S. Southwest little is known about the regions in between where the suggested interaction took place. What little archaeological evidence there is suggests that people, shell (used for jewelry), and other products moved through the Yaqui River Valley from the Sonora coast and may have reached as far as Casas Grandes on the east side of the Sierra Madre Occidental, or the U.S. Southwest to the north. The Onavas Valley Project will provide important data allowing preliminary but critical insights into how pre-Hispanic communities interacted with their environment and their neighbors in a poorly known portion of Northwest Mexico.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to compare the cultural landscape of the Onavas Valley with those of the Hohokam (in the U.S. Southwest), Cerro de Trincheras (northwest Sonora), and Casas Grandes cultures. The comparison will provide the basis for an examination of interactions among these areas and with Mesoamerica. To achieve this, we first intend to discern and define the archaeological traditions within the Onavas Valley and then examine non-local interactions with the aforementioned neighboring areas. We plan to accomplish this goal via three approaches: 1) by building a local chronology and a diagnostic inventory of recorded material culture; 2) by establishing the landscape structure (settlement pattern and ritual and ethnic landscape) of the area; and 3) by collecting and analyzing evidence for the manufacture, use, and exchange of trade goods.<br/><br/>Beyond research questions of interest to archaeology, this project will have a broader impact by enhancing the level of public understanding of archaeology in the communities of the Onavas Valley and in Sonora, and in the Southwest of United States. The project will establish a basis for future archaeological research and education in the area by enhancing research collaboration between U.S. and Mexican scholars, and collaboration with the local communities by involving students and volunteers from both countries, and employing local workers. Public outreach efforts (posters, school visits, town meetings) have been undertaken already in the principal communities of the Onavas Valley and will continue during and after data collection and analysis. Furthermore, the results of this investigation will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in journals in both countries, in both Spanish and English. Mexican and American students will gain personal and educational experience by participating in a bi-national project and training in the methods of field survey and material analyses."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Landscape Structure, Macroregional Interaction, and Variation among Mississippian Chiefdoms of the Interior Coastal Plain, Georgia",ARCHAEOLOGY,2003-11-01,Paul Fish,2004-10-31,Paul Fish,"Under the supervision of Dr. Paul R. Fish, John F. Chamblee will conduct an archaeological survey in the Chickasawhatchee Swamp of southwestern Georgia. From approximately A.D. 1000 - 1600, the area was home to one or more chiefdoms. Chiefdoms are societies whose members are ruled by a person or group with inherited leadership rights. Such inheritances are often seen as being divinely sanctioned. Unlike kingdoms or states, chiefdoms are generally organized without standing armies, formal literacy, or a bureaucracy. Chiefs instead govern through the strength of their personalities as well as through their ability to attract followers using a combination of exotic gifts, surplus food, and limited physical force. <br/><br/>Chiefdoms were prevalent throughout the southeastern United States during the first half of the last millennium, but the Chickasawhatchee chiefdoms are unusual among them in terms of their geographic location. These societies are not located in a coastal region or along a major river, as are most other chiefdoms in southeastern United States. In addition, the Chickasawhatchee Swamp is located between no less than nine other contemporaneous societies in neighboring regions - some of which were chiefdoms and some of which were not. Analysis of survey data will allow for a greater understanding of the ways in which the natural environment and interactions between neighboring societies contribute to variation among chiefdoms.<br/><br/>Research on chiefdoms is important because it allows us to understand political power at the level of face-to-face interaction and in the absence of the more complex institutions common in states. While archaeologists cannot document interactions the way ethnographers might, we can see the long-term consequences of strategies used repeatedly by chiefs as they attempted to consolidate and maintain power. Monuments like earthen mounds are indicators of the ability to mobilize labor in public projects. The dispersed swamp resources discouraged compact villages, making labor mobilization by chiefs more difficult. Documentation of mound size and surrounding villages, as well as nearby small family settlements, will provide a basis for understanding the kinds of opportunities available to chiefs in such a natural setting.<br/><br/>Items like coastal shell, stone tools made from non-local materials, and decorated pottery are all evidence that chiefs traded with outsiders in order to provide rewards for loyal followers. By analyzing these items, one can gain insights into the relationships between the chiefdoms of the Chickasawhatchee and their neighbors in other regions. The artifact chronology developed during data analysis will be used to trace the growth, maintenance, and eventual decline of the Chickasawhatchee chiefdoms. Comparing this history to that of neighboring regions will provide clues as to the possibility of inter-regional trade, warfare, and other kinds of social interaction.<br/><br/> This project will have an impact outside the scientific community. Undergraduate volunteers will be trained in fieldwork techniques, as will local volunteers. In addition, very little archaeological research has occurred in southwestern Georgia, while commercial artifact prospecting is on the rise. As a result, the general public in not aware of either of the importance of archaeological site preservation, or the history these sites represent. Lectures are planned at civic organizations, schools, and relevant government agencies. Outreach to local collectors will encourage them to share information with archaeologists. Since much of the research is being conducted on private land, reports on the excavations will be provided to landowners."
Collaborative Research: Producing Wildlife: Biodiversity Conservation in Dynamic Commodity Landscapes,GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES,2012-07-01,Paul Robbins,2012-10-31,Krithi Karanth,"This project considers the ways in which biodiversity conservation and agriculturally-based livelihoods can exist together in a way that is beneficial to both. It is increasingly well understood that closed park (or 'fortress') approaches to conservation may be insufficient to address the current global biodiversity crisis on its own and that such approaches have sometimes proven destructive to local livelihoods and people. By determining where local agricultural and economic activities also benefit biodiversity, the research seeks to find win-win approaches to preserving wildlife and maintaining livelihoods. This research therefore seeks to determine: 1) the degree to which plantation landscapes (e.g. coffee, tea, rubber) in central India foster native biodiversity; 2) what producer practices and decisions support such diversity; and 3) what socio-economic conditions encourage or discourage biodiversity-friendly production. The investigators hypothesize that specific conditions such as range of plantation area, use of inputs, and the intensity of production encourage habitat appropriate for wildlife. This will be tested using a combination of methods including intensive ecological observation and measurement. The work also stresses how local agricultural choices bear on preserving or thwarting bird and mammal populations of conservation interest. As such, the work involves interviews with local agrarian producers to determine what land management strategies they employ (e.g. fertilizer choice), what conditions favor or discourage such practices (e.g. belonging to a producer cooperative), and the degree to which wildlife is a hindrance to production (e.g. through crop raiding). The research further involves the reconstruction of historical conditions that have led to crop and production choices that exist today, including a survey of changing commodity prices and land cover. <br/><br/>The results will likely reveal agricultural configurations and decisions that favor specific wildlife species. The research will also assess the degree to which such systems are sensitive to the vagaries of commodity price shifts as well as local institutional change. These findings can help determine which wildlife species are being maintained in areas distant from sites of controlled conservation effort. Results can inform future policies which encourage and reward local people for maintaining specific crops and cropping approaches of value to biodiversity. The research also stands to open future dialogues on the role of local people in conservation more generally, moving away from confrontational situations more typically associated with community-wildlife interactions. Finally, the study stresses the broadening of conservation attention and direction of resources to heavily humanized places in the world, an urgent question in light of the ongoing global transformation of the earth's surface by people. The project will train numerous graduate students at two United States institutions, as well volunteer citizen science participants in the study region in India. Resulting ecological and economic data, maps, and survey findings will be loaded into publically available websites and findings will be published in academic as well as other outlets."
Linking the Dendrochronology of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean: Yenikapi,ARCHAEOLOGY,2012-01-01,Peter Kuniholm,2013-08-31,Peter Kuniholm,"With three years of National Science Foundation support, the principal investigator, Peter Kuniholm, and the Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory will work to finish building an absolutely-dated tree-ring chronology for the Eastern Mediterranean complete back to 3000 BC and possibly to 7000 BC or before. 7500 years' worth of chronologies spanning 9000 years but not yet in a single sequence has already been constructed. Focus will be placed on sample collection from three regions. The first is a large-scale commercial exploitation of Croatian and Bosnian rivers for thousands of stems of subfossil oak, some of which will not only fill sequence gaps but may go back in time to before 10,489 years ago, the present limit of oak chronologies for Northern Europe. The enterprises have agreed to supply slices of all their long-lived material. A second 'target of opportunity' is the unique possibility afforded by the construction of a 39-kilometer-long subway system through the heart of downtown Istanbul. The construction of the tunnel has recently been postponed for a year in order to allow more time for excavation and preservation of some millions of archaeological artifacts, but the completion date for the tunnel is scheduled for four years from now. Archaeological excavations operating in three 8-hour shifts per day in the excavation for the main train station - at Yenikap_ at present 800 meters x 400 meters x 25 meters deep - have so far penetrated through a long series of Ottoman, Byzantine, and late Roman levels, and in one segment as far back as the Neolithic where recently wattle-and-daub fishermen's huts from the 6th millennium BC were unearthed. In the past three years Kuniholm's team has collected over 2000 pilings from a variety of periods at Yenikap_ and in the next three or four years expect to collect 3000 more from the earlier periods. Imported wood from Northern Greece, the Black Sea coast of Turkey, and the Danube - perhaps even up the Danube itself - has already been identified, thereby shedding light on patterns of import and export. Finally Dr. Kuniholm is collaborating with a Bulgarian and EU research effort ""Submerged Landscapes, Reconstructing Palaeoenvironment and Settlement Pattern(s) in Prehistory,"" of which the co-PI (Wazny) is the chairman of the dendrochronological segment. It is expected to retrieve about 1000 dendrochronological samples a year from these sources, some of which are already providing links between the Aegean oak chronology and the absolutely-dated North European oak chronology. <br/><br/><br/>Building a continuous tree-ring time-line from the present to the Neolithic or earlier will allow dating to the year for a variety of cultures in the Near East, Aegean, and Balkans, at present only poorly linked. If the Croatian and Bosnian rivers yield what one might reasonably expect, this will also permit calibration of the European oak radiocarbon timescale before the current 8480 BC. The Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory is a leading US scientific organization and plays a major role in training undergraduate and graduate students in dendrochronology. This grant will also help to maintain the laboratory at it high level of productivity and allow it to continue in its mentoring role."
Reconstructing Language Change and Variation,"CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, LINGUISTICS",2015-03-01,Peter Norquest,2016-08-31,Peter Norquest,"People have long been fascinated with spoken language, one of the most salient traits that defines human beings as unique. Language, by its very nature, is prone to change for both cognitive and social reasons. The study of language variation -- how and why it changes, and the fact that an earlier form of the language can be reconstructed based on evidence from its daughters -- is therefore a primary way to understand the cultural history of its speakers. Since the principles of variation, change, and reconstruction methodology can be applied to any group of related languages, the insight gleaned from studying one particular language family can be extrapolated to all others around the globe. When combined with the increasingly rapid advances being made in human language technology, this knowledge is crucial to facilitating American understanding of other cultures, developing new language-based technologies, and remaining technologically competitive in an increasingly interconnected world.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is the reconstruction of the Kam-Sui branch of the Kra-Dai language phylum of Southeast Asia, a region in which the Principle Investigator, Dr. Peter Norquest (University of Arizona), has extensive experience. Recent publications, primarily by native and Chinese fieldworkers, make this an attainable goal in a way that has not been possible previously. The research will build on the already completed reconstructions of two sister branches, Proto Tai and Proto Hlai, explicating the historical relationships between them and allowing the inference of demographic expansions in prehistory. It comprises a significant step toward completing a top-level reconstruction of Proto Kra-Dai, which will in turn allow testing the Austro-Tai hypothesis, which postulates a genetic relationship between Austronesian and Kra-Dai. Since the nature of the relationships between the five primary language phyla of Southeast Asia has been a longstanding topic of debate amongst historical linguists, this project will also benefit scholars working on the other three language phyla of the region (Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, and Hmong-Mien), as historical contact will be made amenable to a more refined analysis than has previously been possible. The commitment by the Center for Research on Computational Linguistics (CRCL) to grant advance access to their Kam-Sui database will enable the goals of this project to be rapidly achieved; the reconstructions resulting from this project will then be merged into a more extensive online repository to be made available to the public via the online interface at sealang.net. Both the reconstructions and the practical and theoretical insights gleaned from the project will be released in a series of publications."
"A multi-scale integrated approach to historical linguistic and demographic reconstruction in Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2010-10-01,Peter Norquest,2013-09-30,Sean Downey,"Dr. Peter K. Norquest (University of Arizona) and Dr. Sean S. Downey (Stanford University and University of Arizona) will undertake research on the effects of community-level language interactions on prehistoric migration patterns in Nusa Tenggara, a large region in eastern Indonesia. The history of this region remains obscure because contact between Papuan-speakers and Austronesian-speakers (circa 4,500 BP) and subsequent drift has since obscured many of the linguistic criteria which historical linguists typically use to reconstruct migrations. Recent developments in computational linguistic can help overcome some of these obstacles. The researchers will integrate two independent methodologies and improve on them by including both local and regional scales of analysis. Thus this project will produce new methodologies that can be used by other researchers concerned with problems that involve historical reconstructions of population movements where historical records are lacking.<br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the relationship between community-level and regional-level language patterns by analyzing a database of words collected from numerous locations across Nusa Tenggara. Two computational analyses will be used, each proven accurate at a different spatial scale, and these will be complemented by the more traditional ""comparative method"" in which a trained historical linguist manually classifies languages based on the phonological and morphological differences in their lexicons. The results of these analyses are expected to shed light on how linguistic interaction among people in neighboring communities have affected language patterns that are observed in the wake of large-scale demographic transitions. <br/><br/>The research is significant because it will clarify a poorly understood aspect of the last great human migration prior to the modern era: the Austronesian expansion from Mainland China into Indonesia and ultimately the colonization of islands across the Pacific Ocean. The methodology for integrating computational linguistic analysis across scales that will be developed during the course of this project will be applicable for reconstructing the demographic history of indigenous populations wherever historical records are unavailable."
Dissertation Research: A Spatial Analysis of Classic Bonito Phase Chacoan Great House Communities,ARCHAEOLOGY,1995-04-15,R. Gwinn Vivian,1998-03-31,R. Gwinn Vivian,"Vivian Under the direction of Dr. R. Gwinn Vivian, Ms. Ruth Van Dyke will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will examine site plans for 9 Bonito-style prehistoric sites which are located in New Mexico in the Chaco Canyon region. At seven of the sites, extensive surface remains and architectural ruins have already been mapped and Ms. Van Dyke will digitize the site plans. This will facilitate spatial analysis. At the remaining two sites Ms. Van Dyke and assistants will use a laser transit system to produce comparable data. With this information she shall search for similarities and differences between sites and compare these to central Chaco Canyon ruins. Within sites she will attempt to determine social relations among occupants and learn whether a hierarchical system existed. Factors such as room size, arrangement and accessibility will provide a means to address this question. In the centuries immediately preceding contact with the Old World, Southwest Native American societies developed complex social systems and built sites with multi-story architecture which accommodated hundreds of individuals. A center for such development was Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. It is clear that a strong relationship existed between Chaco Canyon and over 100 outlying communities since a system of prehistoric roads connects many of these sites. However archaeologists do not understand how the Chaco system functioned. They do not know whether the Chaco ""center"" is responsible for the establishment of the outlier or whether essentially independent communities cooperated and that the periphery, in effect, created the core. It is also not known whether these communities were essentially equalitarian or hierarchial. The question is important because it will shed light on the social processes which gave rise to this well known society. Through architectural analysis Ms. Van Dyke can address both of these issues. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the development of social complexity and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: The Dynamics of Grinding Technology and Prehistoric Mogollon Culture,"ARCHAEOLOGY, SPECIAL PROGRAMS-RESERVE",1991-08-15,Raymond Thompson,1994-07-31,Jenny Adams,"Under the direction of Dr. Raymond Thompson, Ms Jenny Adams will collect data for her doctoral dissertation in Anthropology. She will continue her study of prehistoric ground stone implements to gain insight into the functions which they served. Employing concepts derived from tribology she will replicated tools used by prehistoric Southwestern U.S. groups and employ them in different tasks such as grinding corn, seeds and bone. These will be repeated with different types of lithic raw material. The polish and abrasion which results on the stone surfaces will be examined with both macro and microscopic techniques in an attempt to match use with wear type. Preliminary work with sandstone implements has yielded positive results. In conjunction with this research, Ms Adams will review the ethnographic literature to determine the range of uses to which ground stone implements have been put. She will also use the experimental results to analyze a large series of prehistoric tools recovered in archaeological excavations of the Point of Pines site. Over the last several decades, archaeologists have made great strides in the analysis of flaked stone artifacts. Through study of edge damage and experimental replication, they have determined the uses to which many prehistoric tools were put and these insights have permitted more detailed reconstructions of technology and lifestyle. Almost no work, however, has been done on ground stone even though such artifacts are routinely recovered in many parts of the world. Ms Adam's project will help to fill this gap. This research is important for several reasons. It will develop a methodological tool which will be used by archaeologists in many different situations. It will provide new insight into prehistoric Southwest adaptations and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
Methodological Training in Remote Sensing and GIS for Comparative Study of Farming Strategies Among the Kofyar and the Tiv of Nigeria,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1994-07-01,Robert Netting,1995-06-30,Robert Netting,"9405712 Netting Thiq project supports the research and training of a cultural anthropologist from the University of Arizona. As part of a project studying peasant agricultural production in Nigeria, the investigator, a senior professor, will study the use of Geographic Information Systems, mapping software, and the analysis of remote sensing imagery at Indiana University. The research questions involve explaining how peasant farmers exploited a newly farmed region in Nigeria with traditional hoe farming technologies, what their economic efficiencies are, and how they maintain food self-sufficiency as well as market production. The learning process will rely mainly on analysis of three Landsat scenes spanning a number of years using ERDAS (an imaging software), three series of aerial photographs from 1963, 1972, and 1978, and ARCINFO (a GIS program). The integration of ethnographic information with remote sensing is still experimental and innovative, rather than routine, for social scientists. The training will take place at the Center for Training and Research on Global Environmental Change at Indiana University. This project is important because it strengthens the scientific expertise of American social scientists in this new technology at the same time that the training involves dealing with critically important research questions involving food self-sufficiency in sub-Saharan Africa."
Archaeological Chronology Development and the Old Wood Problem on the Northern Colorado Plateau,ARCHAEOLOGY,2010-07-15,Ronald Towner,2012-06-30,Jeffrey Dean,"With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ronald H. Towner, colleagues and students will examine the 'old wood' problem in radiocarbon dating of archaeological sites in western Colorado and eastern Utah. The old wood problem is the tendency for radiocarbon (14C) determinations from wood charcoal to be significantly older than the contexts in which the charcoal is found. Five factors can make firewood dates significantly earlier than their archaeological or modern contexts: 1) the tendency of people to use dead wood for fuel; 2) a dead tree or dead branch may have died long before its wood was used for fuel; 3) weathering, decay, or insect activity after tree death can remove many exterior rings and increase the gap between the date of the deadwood remnant and the time of its use; 4) removal of additional exterior rings by burning can further expand the gap; and 5) dating rings from the inner part of the wood's ring series widens the gap still further. Operating singly or together, these processes can produce a gap between date and wood use that exceeds the uncertainty range of radiocarbon dates and thereby seriously overestimate the age of the site involved. This proposed project uses both radiocarbon and tree-ring dating to examine the impacts of 'old wood' procurement on interpretations of the prehistoric and historical period occupations of western Colorado and eastern Utah. <br/><br/>Previous research indicates that the magnitude of the old wood problem varies spatially, environmentally, and perhaps culturally. By collecting abundant samples in three areas along an environmental gradient, the project will assess the impacts of different environments on the age and availability of fuelwood resources. The construction of local multi-species multi-century tree-ring chronologies will be particularly important for dating of Fremont, Gateway Tradition, and Ute sites in western Colorado and eastern Utah, and may be critical in understanding Fremont/Ute relationships and Ute ethnogenesis. This proposed project will help us develop wood use models for the three groups and provide interpretive guidelines for dating the sites. Thus, the intellectual merit of the project is to test environmental variability of radiocarbon dates, create new tree-ring chronologies for the area, develop new models of cultural wood use practices, and evaluate technological change as a factor in radiocarbon dating of sites in these areas.<br/><br/>This project will have broader impacts beyond the Fremont, Gateway Tradition, and Ute archaeology in western Colorado and Eastern Utah. It will make important contributions toward the understanding of radiocarbon dating and wood use practices in arid and semi-arid environments worldwide. The project will also contribute toward graduate and undergraduate student training and development. It may also contribute to calibration other chronometric techniques, such as archaeomagnetism and thermoluminescence dating, and to refining ceramic seriation studies of prehistoric Fremont and protohistoric and early historic Ute pottery types. It will refine models of wood use that may have implications for understanding the impacts of technological change on the exploitation of timber resources."
Dendroarchaeology of the Range Creek Fremont,ARCHAEOLOGY,2005-08-01,Ronald Towner,2007-07-31,"K Renee Barlow, Matthew Salzer","With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Ronald Towner, Renee Barlow, and Matthew Salzer will conduct two seasons of tree-ring research on the largest set of pristine Fremont archaeological sites yet identified. As one part of a larger collaborative effort involving students from four universities and volunteers from two interest groups, the project will significantly enhance our scientific understanding of the Fremont culture of northeastern Utah (AD 800-1300) including its florescence as an agricultural society and demise prior to Euroamerican contact. The team will also examine variations in rainfall patterns in the area for the past 800-1000 years and relate such changes to changing Fremont, Ute, and historic ranching land use patterns. The goals of the project are to collect and date tree-ring samples from as many as 50 previously unknown Fremont structures, develop multi-century long tree-ring chronologies, reconstruct precipitation patterns of northeastern Utah for the past thousand years, and create models of human/environment interaction in semi-arid environments that may have global applications.<br/><br/>As part of this effort, the investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students, and volunteers, in the proper collection of archaeological and live-tree samples so that they will be able to continue the research after the end of the project. Both graduate and undergraduate students will use the project data as part of their research projects.<br/><br/>This project is a unique and exciting opportunity to develop collaborations between different universities and interest groups while researching pristine Fremont archaeological sites, climate variability for the past 1000 years, and the myriad ways people adapted to their semi-arid environment in good times and in bad times. The project will provide the basis for major revisions in the scientific understanding of the Fremont and to understanding human/environment interactions."
Dendroarchaeology of the Gallina,ARCHAEOLOGY,2013-07-01,Ronald Towner,2015-12-31,Ronald Towner,"With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ronald H. Towner and students from the University of Arizona will conduct two seasons of research on the Gallina culture of northern New Mexico. The prehistoric Gallina have long been an enigma. Similar in many ways to other prehistoric Anasazi groups, the Gallina have been defined as a phase, and later, a separate culture. What is known is that the Gallina lived during a time of social and environmental changes that occurred across a broad area, but many questions about the Gallina remain unanswered in part because the Gallina chronologies have not been fully developed. Basic questions regarding Gallina population dynamics, settlement patterns, social organization, and adaptation to environmental change simply cannot be adequately addressed with the current chronological data. This project will remedy this situation for a key portion of the Gallina area. It will also contribute to our understanding of the effects of migration - not on migrants or host communities - but on communities along-the-path of migration streams.<br/><br/>This project will significantly enhance understanding of the Gallina in specific and attainable ways. First, researchers will analyze more than two thousand tree-ring samples excavated from major Gallina sites in the 1970s, that were never submitted for analysis. These samples have now been transferred to the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (LTRR) at the University of Arizona, where they will be analyzed and permanently curated As part of the tree-ring analysis, the team will develop internal site chronologies that will contribute to understanding Gallina social organization and demographics; they will also significantly enlarge the number of Christian-calendar dates and place the Gallina more firmly in time and space. Only one area map exists from earlier work, and it is woefully inadequate. The investigators will use modern Geographic Positioning Systems technology to map the previously excavated sites, and correlate them with the original field maps produced in the 1970s. Producing digital maps will significantly enhance current and future research efforts by providing detailed provenience information at the site, structure, and room level. Existing tree-ring reconstructions of precipitation will be used to elucidate aspects of precipitation variability during the Gallina occupation and relate that variability to Gallina social and demographic change. Finally, all previous and newly generated tree-ring dates from Gallina sites will be synthesized and all of data, except sensitive site locations, will be published on a website hosted by the LTRR. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project will reach beyond the Gallina. The research will make important contributions toward understanding how and under what conditions various forms of social organization developed in the prehispanic Southwest. Models of such social formation processes will contribute to a broader understanding of human social organization during periods of demographic, climatic, and political stress. This project will result in significant advances in understanding Gallina cultural dynamics and social organization; it will illuminate important aspects of Gallina population dynamics, enhance anthropological theories of mixed-economy social organization, and augment our understanding of the impacts of migration on ""intermediate"" communities. The project will also contribute toward student training and development by employing both graduate and undergraduate students who will be involved in all phases of the project. It will also demonstrate the utility of existing collections that have been ignored for decades."
Dendroarchaeology and Early Dinetah Navajo Social Organization,ARCHAEOLOGY,2008-06-01,Ronald Towner,2010-05-31,Ronald Towner,"With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ronald Towner, students, and volunteers, will conduct two seasons of archaeological tree-ring sampling, analysis, and interpretation of a large set of pristine Early Navajo archaeological sites in the Navajo homeland of Dinetah in northwestern New Mexico. <br/> This project will: (1) more than double the number of tree-ring samples collected from Gobernador Phase (AD 1650-1775) Navajo sites with a concomitant increase in the number of absolute dates, (2) delineate the temporal and spatial aspects of three areas of known high-density 18th century Navajo occupation and compare them to existing data from three previous projects, (3) synthesize all tree-ring dated Navajo sites in Dinetah, (4) compare and contrast Early Navajo settlement patterns with extant tree-ring based reconstructions of climate, and (5) build new models of Early Navajo demography and social organization at the household, residence group, mid-level, community, and possibly tribal level. The resulting data and interpretations will significantly aid archaeologists, anthropologists, historians, and geographers in understanding the occupation of Dinetah by Early Navajo social groups, the broader population dynamics of the early historical period in the northern Southwest, and the relationships between human behavioral variability, climate variability, and sociopolitical change.<br/> Navajo social organization has been the subject of extensive and intensive anthropological research for decades, but the vast majority of such research has concentrated on Reservation-era (post-1868) groups west of the Chuska Mountains. Early Navajo archaeology in Dinetah provides an opportunity to examine the social organization of pre-Reservation Navajo groups who were not committed to pastoralism, but instead practiced a very mixed economy during times of severe climatic and social stress. This project will use tree-ring, archaeological, anthropological, historical, and extant oral history data to illuminate aspects of Gobernador phase Navajo settlement prior to the adoption of a pastoral lifeway and will significantly enhance our understanding of Early Navajo social organization prior to the Navajo transformation to pastoralism. The project will result in significant advances in understanding Early Navajo cultural dynamics and social organization; it will illuminate important aspects of Early Navajo demography, and enhance anthropological theories of mid-level social organization.<br/> This project will have significant impacts beyond the Dinetah Navajo and archaeology. It will make important contributions toward understanding how and under what conditions various forms of social organization developed in a pre-industrial, frontier-contact society. Models of such social formation processes will contribute to a broader understanding of human social organization during periods of demographic, climatic, and sociopolitical stress. The project will also contribute toward student training and development. It may also contribute to calibration other chronometric techniques, such as archaeomagnetism and thermoluminescence dating, and to refining ceramic seriation studies of protohistoric and early historic pottery types. It will refine models of Navajo wood use that may have implications for understanding the impacts of technological change on the exploitation of forest resources."
Dissertation Grant: Evaluating Levantine Early Upper Paleolithic Prismatic Blade Technology,ARCHAEOLOGY,2002-01-01,Steven Kuhn,2003-12-31,Kristopher Kerry,"Under the direction of Dr. Steven L. Kuhn, Mr. Kristopher W. Kerry will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. This research will quantitatively examine relationships between several different Early Upper Paleolithic stone-tool assemblages associated with the Early Ahmarian lithic tradition. Found throughout most of the eastern Mediterranean region known as the Levant, the Early Ahmarian ranges in age from 25-40,000 years ago, and represents one of the earliest Upper Paleolithic industries in the world and perhaps the earliest example of prismatic blade production in Eurasia. This specific method of stone-tool production, used to produce numerous elongated removals (blades) from a single piece of stone, differs significantly from earlier stone-working techniques, and is contemporaneous with broad-scale changes in human behavior and population dispersal argued to occur throughout Eurasia circa 30-40,000 years ago. <br/><br/>Despite this distinction, the Early Ahmarian tradition was not recognized until the early 1980s, when it was distinguished from another Upper Paleolithic technological tradition. This separation, centering on the high percentage of blade elements, was a significant contribution in characterizing Levantine Upper Paleolithic variability. However, over the past two decades the Ahmarian has become a designation for many, highly variable assemblages whose only common denominator is a ""bladey"" appearance. Understandably, such a classification scheme has made the taxonomic use of the Early Ahmarian somewhat cumbersome. While prismatic blade technology defines the Early Ahmarian, descriptions based on quantitative measures associated with the manufacture of blades are rare. This research will examine relationships between eight different Early Ahmarian assemblages by evaluating blade production strategies using quantitative measures. These assemblages form a transect through south-central Sinai, southwest Jordan, the Negev, central Lebanon, and south-central Turkey and represent various environmental and site settings. Additionally, three ""out-group"" assemblages will also be examined. These out-group assemblages are included in attempts to identify common themes in Early Ahmarian blade production strategies by comparing them with prismatic blade manufacture from southeast Europe and other stone-tool production techniques considered quite distinct from the Early Ahmarian within the Levant itself. In quantitatively describing blade production strategies associated with these eleven assemblages a consistent method of comparison may help distinguish regional distinctions associated with local environment and site location, as well as identify common themes within the Early Ahmarian. Only after Early Ahmarian technological variability is better defined can questions relating to the dispersal of prismatic blade production throughout Eurasia within the broader context of behavioral and demographic changes often associated with the Upper Paleolithic period be explored.<br/><br/>Archaeologists know that the earliest anatomically modern humans first appeared in Africa and that they subsequently spread throughout both Old and New Worlds. Although one might assume that cultural attributes such as stone tools spread the same way, the archaeological evidence is far from clear. Mr. Kerry's research will provide relevant data. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: The Upper San Pedro Revisited: Early Paleoindian Subsistence and Geochronology in Southeastern Arizona,ARCHAEOLOGY,2007-06-01,Steven Kuhn,2008-05-31,Steven Kuhn,"The earliest uncontested human population to enter North America is recognized by archaeologists as the Clovis complex. When found in archaeological sites, their tools are often associated with extinct large mammals such as mammoth. Human predation on big-game prey such as mammoth is one of the most debated and significant research topics in American archaeology. The most robust record of human-mammoth interaction occurs in the San Pedro River valley of Southeastern Arizona, where radiocarbon dates indicate that Ice Age hunters killed and butchered mammoth and an extinct form of bison approximately 13,000 years ago. A total of six sites occur within a 15 km radius, and this concentration of sites is used to demonstrate not only a hunting economy focused on big game, but also its impact on megafauna ecology and extinction.<br/><br/>The search for additional Clovis complex sites and mammoth sites in the San Pedro River valley is important for 3 reasons. First, nearly all of the previous mammoth sites were discovered by ranchers who noticed large bones eroding from their property. This circumstance creates a discovery bias for large mammals and perhaps misrepresents the everyday diet of Clovis people. A systematic survey along the San Pedro River for all forms of archaeological evidence is needed to test the association of Clovis tools with large game. Second, the role of human ""overkill"" in Pleistocene extinction suffers from an incomplete sample of sites. The dense cluster of mammoth kill sites in the study area must be considered in relation to a sample of mammoth natural death sites to determine what impact, if any, human hunting could have had on mammoth populations. And third, the timing of human colonization sets important conditions necessary to accommodate the role of big-game hunting on Pleistocene ""overkill"". Additional radiocarbon dates are required to better assess the arrival and duration of Clovis groups in the study area.<br/><br/>To address these questions a one-year study of the upper San Pedro will be conducted. Site location, subsistence and geochronological information will be recorded. Data will be collected using pedestrian surveys and limited archaeological excavations at a small number of sites. Significant geological and archaeological talent and resources are available at the University of Arizona to assist in the fulfillment of these goals.<br/><br/>The Pleistocene record of the San Pedro River is popular in the history of American archaeology, paleontology, geoarchaeology, and paleoecology. As part of the San Pedro River National Conservation Area, the project is still more widely relevant to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and their mission to foster understanding of past and present cultures, improve social studies and science education, and enhance citizenship education to help preserve archaeological legacy. At the project level, this outreach includes K-12 school visits, public lectures, local media opportunities, website development, and archaeological training for several undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Arizona."
"Exploring the Initial Upper Paleolithic at Êagizli Cave, Turkey",ARCHAEOLOGY,2001-07-01,Steven Kuhn,2004-06-30,Steven Kuhn,"With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Steven Kuhn and a<br/>group of international researchers will continue archaeological excavations<br/>at UUagizli (""three mouths"") cave in south-central Turkey. The team includes<br/>professional archaeologists, physical anthropologists, geologists, and specialists<br/>in the analysis of ancient plant remains, as well as graduate students from<br/>the U.S., Turkey, and western Europe. The central goal of the project is<br/>to examine evidence for marked changes in human behavior within the earliest<br/>Upper Paleolithic period, and to place these developments in their environmental<br/>context. Archaeological deposits at the site span the period between about<br/>30,000 and 43,000 years before present. Although humans with essentially<br/>modern skeletal anatomy had appeared much earlier, many researchers believe<br/>that it was only after 45,000 years ago that there is evidence in Eurasia<br/>for complex technologies, symbolic communication and art, and other features<br/>of material, social and intellectual life that distinguish fully modern<br/>humans from their ancestors. Results from excavations at UUagizli cave<br/>to date have helped expand our understanding of changes in economies and<br/>technology for this crucial interval in human history. The site has also<br/>yielded remains of what are among the earliest ornament-making traditions<br/>in Eurasia. These findings are especially important because they document<br/>the use of material culture as a medium of symbolic communication, long<br/>considered an important rubicon in human cognitive evolution. One issue<br/>guiding the research is whether developments in human behavior after 45,000<br/>years ago represent local responses to changing ecological and demographic<br/>conditions, or whether they reflect the appearance of new human populations<br/>with enhanced cognitive abilities. Continuing excavations will allow us<br/>to examine in detail the timing of major shifts in behavior, and whether<br/>they occurred independently or in concert. Studies of animal bones, remains<br/>of shellfish, as well as ancient pollen and phytoliths (durable crystalline<br/>components of plant tissues) will allow us to place these developments in<br/>their environmental context, helping to distinguish broad evolutionary trends<br/>within the human species as a whole from local adaptations to changing conditions.<br/> At the same time, the project is helping to establish new links between<br/>academic institutions in Turkey and the United States. Through their participation<br/>in the research, students from Ankara University obtain training in field<br/>and lab methods. In exchange, American graduate students get valuable<br/>overseas research experience as well as material for theses and dissertations."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Settlement-Size Scaling and Economic Transformation in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Peru",ARCHAEOLOGY,2013-04-01,Steven Kuhn,2015-03-31,William Haas,"Under the guidance of Drs. Steven Kuhn and Mark Aldenderfer, Randy Haas will analyze the formation histories of five previously recorded Late Archaic Period (7,000-5,000 B.P.) hunter-gatherer sites in the western Lake Titicaca Basin, Peru. The Basin's Late Archaic Period has received little attention even though the period marks the eve of an agricultural transition that led to the endogenous emergence of the Tiwanaku state around A.D. 300. Previous work suggests that nearly all of the hallmarks of social complexity - e.g., residential sedentism, food production, and craft specialization - are represented in the Late Archaic record. However, Haas' recent settlement pattern analyses have revealed a potential signature of social complexity: settlement-size hierarchy. Settlement-size hierarchy refers to a statistical pattern in site-size distribution that geographers, economists, and archaeologists have described as the rank-size rule, Zipf's law, or a power law. Differential erosion and burial do not appear to explain the observed site-size pattern, supporting a behavioral model instead. The archaeological observation in the Titicaca Late Archaic may represent a first for prehistoric hunter-gatherer settlement pattern analysis and raises the question of how it could emerge among mobile foragers. Several models of settlement and site-formation are considered, and test excavations at the largest Late Archaic Period sites in the Ilave sub-basin will generate chronometric and material data for testing model-driven hypotheses.<br/><br/>Understanding behaviors that drive emergent social complexity in human societies is of paramount importance to anthropological research. Archaeological observations provide a means for inferring the order in which key behaviors appeared in trajectories of increasing complexity. The Lake Titicaca Basin, one of few world regions to have witnessed archaic state formation, offers a critical case study. Archaeologists have shown that incipient sedentism, food-production, and pastoralism appeared ca. 5,500 B.P. in the Titicaca Basin Terminal Archaic Period. The first clear signs of craft specialization, social stratification, and monumental architecture appeared subsequently ca. 3,500 B.P. in the Formative Period. Previous settlement-pattern analyses have suggested that settlement-size hierarchies emerged in the Formative. However, because statistically indistinguishable site-size hierarchies appeared at least 2,000 years earlier in the Late Archaic Period, prior to any other dimension of social complexity, one could hypothesize that site-size scaling catalyzed incipient complexity in the Titicaca Basin rather than the other way around as current models suggest. The anthropological question that follows and drives the current research is, What forager behavior generated the archaeological site-size pattern? Stratigraphic, radiocarbon, feature, and lithic data from test excavations in the five largest Late Archaic Period sites in the Ilave region will be used to infer the degree to which these sites reflect comparatively long occupations, frequent re-occupations, and/or large-group occupation.<br/><br/>Excavations and laboratory activities will foster stronger international relations with Peruvians - Ayamara and non-indigenous, academic and non-academic. All new data will be curated and made available to qualified individuals by the Peruvian Ministry of Culture and The Digital Archaeological Record. Analytical results will be presented to Peruvian and U.S. communities in public talks, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed publications ranging from regional to theoretical in scope."
"Late Pleistocene Prehistory of the Hatay, Turkey",ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-06-15,Steven Kuhn,2001-05-31,Steven Kuhn,"With National Science Foundation support Drs. Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner will conduct two field seasons of research at three archaeological sites located in the Hatay region of Turkey. Because of its position near the Syrian border, the sites are situated in an important transition zone at the edge of the Middle East. Work by prior excavators, as well as preliminary research at these sites by Kuhn and Stiner indicates that all three contain long sequences of Upper Paleolithic material and that the earliest levels likely exceed 40,000 years in age. This makes them of great anthropological significance. In Europe at approximately 40,000 years ago an important biological and cultural change took place when anatomically modern humans succeeded Neanderthal peoples and an Upper Paleolithic technology characterized by a different more function specific stone tool technology, bone tools and art replaced a more general technological adaptation. In Europe, where archaeological data are abundant, it is fairly clear that replacement rather than in situ development took place. However the point of origin for the Upper Paleolithic industries is unknown and the underlying process which led to their emergence is not understood. Anatomically modern humans are present in the Near East prior to their appearance in Europe and paleoanthropologists have thus focused their attention on this area. It is this fact together with the early dates and presence of bone tools which make the Hatay sites so interesting. Because stratigraphic data indicate that they document long periods of time, it is possible to consider them from the perspective of development as well or origins. The research team will conduct preliminary stratigraphic excavations. They will collect and analyze both the lithic and faunal remains and collect samples for radiometric dating. On this basis a longer term project is planned."
Dissertation: Landscape Learning in the Late Glacial Recolonization of Northwestern Europe,ARCHAEOLOGY,2000-12-01,Steven Kuhn,2001-11-30,Steven Kuhn,"With the support of Dr. Steven Kuhn, Ms. Marcy Rockman will collect and analyze data for her doctoral dissertation. Using the example of the resettlement of northwestern Europe at the end of the last Ice Age, she will study how humans come to know and use natural resources when they can only learn about them from the landscape itself. During the last Ice Age, which dates to approximately 20,000 to 14,000 years ago, the ice sheets reached almost to the location of present-day London and human populations were concentrated in southwestern France and in the central Rhine valley. By the time the ice retreated, the region from the Paris Basin northward through the British Isles had been abandoned for at least 6,000 years. The first humans to re- enter this area had to learn the locations and limitations of the region's natural resources anew, using only their knowledge of landscape from which they had come and their own experiences in the unfamiliar environment. While such colonizations with limited information have taken place many times throughout human history, the actual process by which humans learn a new landscape is not yet well understood. Ms. Rockman's research will develop a means of studying this process and focus closely on the very beginnings of the modern human occupation of northwestern Europe.<br/><br/>In this study, the landscape learning process will be studied from the perspective of human discovery and early use of outcrops of chert, a fine-grained rock commonly used to make stone tools in prehistory. Ms. Rockman will collect published stone tool sourcing, radiocarbon date, and other artifact assemblage information from sites dating between approximately 14,000 and 9,500 years ago from England, northern France, and eastern Belgium. Selected extant stone tool collections representing this full time range will be studied in regard to the range of rock and particularly chert types represented. Using the stone tool sourcing information as a guide to specific geological features and areas, Ms. Rockman will take field measurements of the topography of the chert sources. All this data will then be combined in geographic information systems (GIS) analyses. Final interpretations will be made from the characteristics and use patterns of individual chert sources and comparison of the overall complexity of land use across the late glacial and early post-glacial time periods.<br/><br/>This project will provide help to explain how humans learn to live in a new place. It will provide a base of both data and method against which archaeologists may test other colonizations. It will serve as an example of the potential of combined archaeological, geological, and computer modeling research, and it will contribute to the interdisciplinary training of a promising young scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation: The Impact of Circular Migration on Female Gender Norms; What Martinican Women Say and How They Say it.,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2000-06-01,Susan Philips,2001-11-30,Susan Philips,"This linguistic anthropology project will examine the impact of circular migration on female gender norms. It specifically analyzes how migrant women of Martinique are presented with two different models of gender in their home (island) and receiving communities (France), and how these models (and associated identities) are negotiated. Research will center on language use as an indictor and measure of how women think about and actively construct their gendered identities and relations."
Doctoral Dissertation Research: An Ethnographic Investigation of Material Implications of Oral Health and Health Care in Central Appalachia,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,2010-05-15,Susan Shaw,2012-04-30,Sarah Raskin,"Doctoral student Sarah Raskin (University of Arizona), supervised by Dr. Susan J. Shaw, will undertake cultural anthropological research on the material and symbolic aspects of the mouth in relation to oral health among central Appalachians, for whom toothlessness is both a stigmatizing clich_ and an embodied reality. The goal of the research is to expand social science understanding of stigma, its emobodiment, and its connections to sociopolitical histories of community, state, and nation. The research has been timed to coincide with and collaborate with Virginia initiatives to expand access to basic dental health care in this region.<br/><br/>The researcher will undertake thirteen months of multi-method ethnographic research in southwest Virginia, where 35 percent of adults report loss of many or all teeth, a rate more 7 times that of the rest of the United States. Research methods will include semi-structured interviews; free listing and ranking activities to elicit cultural models of the mouth and its care; structured observation; and media scans. She also will document experiences of tooth loss, oral pain, other dental sequelae, and experiences of home and clinical care. The research data will be analyzed using narrative and cultural consensus techniques. Research questions include: (1) how do healthcare providers, patients, and public health stakeholders conceive of the ideal mouth, ideal oral hygiene, and the possibility of achieving those ideals; and (2) is variability in how stakeholder conceptions correlated with structural, material, political economic, and/or symbolic factors.<br/><br/>This research is significant because it extends narrative and cultural consensus analysis to an illness cluster and site understudied in social science. Through collaboration with local stakeholders, findings from this project will provide baseline data for future studies on the effects of Virginia's pilot project on oral health-care and disease. Funding this project also supports the education of a social scientist."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Food for Body and Soul: Aquatic Resources and Ritual Behavior in Brazilian Shell Mounds,ARCHAEOLOGY,2007-03-01,Suzanne Fish,2008-02-29,Suzanne Fish,"Jabuticabeira II is a massive prehistoric shell mound located on the southern Brazilian coast. Fifty additional conical mounds constructed of shell as a building material dominate the landscape of the study area and suggest that a dense population supported themselves on rich lagoonal resources of fish, shellfish, and waterfowl. Archaeological investigations confirm Jabuticabeira II functioned as a cemetery for surrounding populations over 800 years. Drawing upon previous work of a U.S. and Brazilian team of archaeologists, funded by grants from both countries, Daniela M. Klokler, under the supervision of Dr. Suzanne K. Fish, will study the remains of fish, shellfish, and other animals associated with mortuary rituals and feasts that were part of burial ceremonies. The research will address questions about how shell mound people used aquatic resources in their economic and social relationships.<br/>The symbolic realm will be the focus of the study. The significance of huge shell mounds as funerary monuments is only beginning to be explored, but the realization that most were built in the course of ceremonial activities enhances the importance of research on mortuary practices and the ritual use of faunal resources. Klokler's research will investigate key issues of interest to both anthropologists and archaeologists, such as the social organization of hunter-gatherers, mortuary ritual, cooperation and social complexity, and the importance of detailed zooarchaeological sampling and analysis. The sampling program focuses on individual funerary areas within the shell mound that were used by specific social groups for the burial of their members, hence allowing the study of social relationships. Detailed analysis of the resource composition of deposits in these funerary areas will provide new insights into the social organization and group interactions of shell mound societies from both economic and ritual perspectives. Special attention will be paid to the role of feasting as an arena to strengthen inter- and intragroup alliances and display territoriality, along with the ritual use of fauna as offerings and the roles that various species played in these societies. Also, this research will advance the use of faunal analysis for studies that go beyond subsistence, providing a benchmark for future zooarchaeological research in Brazil.<br/>The proposed research will strengthen international collaboration and dialogue among U.S. and Latin American archaeologists, permitting the fruitful exchange of ideas and data. The city of Jaguaruna contains an impressive number of shell mounds; nevertheless its citizens remain largely unaware of the area's prehistoric heritage. The project will help bridge the gap between today's communities and this heritage through publications, lectures, and monitored visits to the site. Awareness of the rich prehistory of the region can aid preservation of sites that are at risk from development. Specimens collected for analyses ultimately will expand the faunal comparative collections located at the Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and at the Arizona State Museum, in Tucson. The inclusion of Brazilian students in laboratory work will provide an opportunity for exchange of ideas regarding methods of analysis, training in new quantitative techniques, improved qualifications as faunal analysts, and exposure to materials from another geographic region."
"Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Cerro de Moctezuma in the Casas Grandes Ritual Landscape, Chihuahua, Mexico",ARCHAEOLOGY,2005-07-01,Suzanne Fish,2008-06-30,Suzanne Fish,"The prehistoric Casas Grandes culture centered at the large town known as Paquime in northwest Mexico spanned today's international border and combined elements typical of both ancient Mexico and ancestral Puebloans in the U.S. Southwest. Under the direction of Dr. Suzanne K. Fish, Todd A. Pitezel will conduct excavation at Cerro de Moctezuma (Moctezuma Hill) in the Casas Grandes region and subsequent analyses of archaeological materials. Cerro de Moctezuma is unique for having El Pueblito, the only recorded instance of a habitation on a hill among many hundreds of valley sites during the Medio period, ca. A.D. 1200-1450. A variety and quantity of features uncommon for Medio period settlements are found at El Pueblito including adobe architecture, masonry architecture, and rock alignments. A circular rock enclosure unparalleled in size among Medio period examples surrounds the hill summit 200 m above El Pueblito. Qualitative differences between types of features suggest distinguishable functions. Excavation is directed toward the recovery of data from these features that will clarify the role of Cerro de Moctezuma and El Pueblito's inhabitants during the Medio period and why people chose to establish a substantial community inconveniently away from water and food.<br/><br/>Work at Cerro de Moctezuma is important because of its potential for understanding the ritual components within the social organization centered at Paquime. Social scientists recognize the importance of ritual, or any community activity, as a mechanism for collective cooperation and maintenance of identity. Moreover, ethnographic research among societies of divergent levels of complexity documents the use of promontories and features found on them as important elements of ritual systems. When group activities are performed on or in relation to elevated landforms, those landforms become conspicuous and meaningful daily reinforcements of the collective ideas expressed in performances. Cerro de Moctezuma's conspicuous presence at the intersection of three heavily populated valleys and proximity to the regional center Paquime would have positioned El Pueblito's inhabitants as potentially crucial players in the Casas Grandes ritual system. Analyses of materials (e.g., ceramics, stone tools, nonlocal goods) from different features can illuminate the ways in which Cerro de Moctezuma was used. Additionally, the data obtained from analyses can verify or reject the initial evaluation of Cerro de Moctezuma as a ritually charged component of the Casas Grandes regional system.<br/><br/>A significant outcome of the research will be the strengthening of ties among Mexican and U.S. institutions, professional communities, and university students. A binational team of Mexican and United States archaeology students will be assembled for the field research. Archaeology in northern Mexico is relatively unknown compared to the more famous southern counterpart of Mesoamerica. This research advances awareness of northern Mexico's cultural heritage. Finally, as a locally well-known archaeological site, work at Cerro de Moctezuma will introduce local residents to current methods and outcomes of archaeological research through guided tours during excavation and subsequent exhibits and education programs at the Museo de las Culturas del Norte (Museum of the Northern Cultures) at the site of Paquime."
"Dissertation Research: The Ceramics of Piedras Negras, Guatemala",ARCHAEOLOGY,2001-12-15,T. Patrick Culbert,2002-11-30,Arturo Munoz,"Under the direction of Dr. T. Patrick Culbert, Mr. Arturo Munoz will collect data for his dissertation. For the last four years Mr. Munoz has been a member of the archaeological team excavating the ruins of the Classic Maya city of Piedras Negras, Guatemala. Piedras Negras is located in a remote corner of the Peten rainforest and is renowned for the excellent quality of its sculpture and for the unusually complete sequence of dated stelae erected by the cities rulers between A.D. 650 and 800. Piedras Negras is particularly notable because of the heavy emphasis on resist decoration on locally made ceramics. This technique, virtually unknown in other parts of the Maya Lowlands, dominates the Late Classic polychrome ceramic tradition at Piedras Negras. Because of the unusually complete historical record for the site as well as the excellent provenance data available as a result of the recent excavations it is possible to track the development and spread of resist decorated ceramics with a rare degree of precision. Resist decorated ceramic appear first in elite contexts. They are carefully decorated and well fired. Later, more crudely executed resist types become common and are recovered from all levels of settlement. These observations lead to several hypotheses amenable to testing utilizing a variety of quantitative measures. <br/><br/>In general terms, this research is a diachronic study of changing ceramic styles, framing the development of resist-decorated ceramics first as a result of particular historical and social circumstances at Piedras Negras and second, and more broadly, as a result if general processes linking crafting and the possession of cultural goods to processes of political legitimation. With very few exceptions, Americanist archaeologists rarely consider the social component of technological change, becoming what have been described as ""somnambulists"" adopting the position that technological change unfolds automatically according to its own inevitable logic and independently of social and cultural processes. As a result, most archaeological research focusing on technological change has emphasized the effects of increased efficiency on mitigating changing environmental or other conditions. If this research is successful, it will present a model for understanding processes of technological change emphasizing the importance social processes in determining not only the content of emerging technologies, but also their success or failure.<br/><br/>For a variety of reasons the Usumacinta Basin is one of the most understudied part so the Maya Lowlands. This research will provide some of the very first detailed data for the region, and will provide key information on one of the preeminent Lowland Maya sites. This research will not only be a valuable reference for future archaeologists working in the area, it will also interest any member of Guatemalan society curious about their country's ancient past. Finally, this research will assist in the training of a promising young scientist."
"Dissertation Research: Comparative Household Archaeology in the Zapotitan Valley, El Salvador",ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-09-01,T. Patrick Culbert,2000-08-31,Brian McKee,"Under the direction of Dr. T. Patrick Culbert, Mr. Brian McKee will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. His research focuses on a comparison between two archaeological sites, Ceren and San Andres, both occupied during the Classic Period and located in the Zapotitan Valley, El Salvador. The sites differ in terms of both position in a regional settlement system and of preservation. Ceren is unique in Middle America because it represents a Pompei like situation. The small rural village is buried under a protective layer of volcanic ash. Although most (although not all) inhabitants had time to flee before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption, they were able to take few of their possessions with them. Delicate organic materials such as storage gourds are well preserved and objects were left where they were used. The site therefore provides unparalleled insight into the range and spatial distribution of material culture. In the course of their activities, the Ceren people discarded objects which were no longer of use and trash pits similar to those preserved in many Middle American sites were discovered. It is very likely that the inhabitants of adjacent San Andres had a range of material culture and way of life similar, in most essentials, to their Ceren contemporaries. San Andres however was not subject to similar volcanic forces and abandonment occurred in a more gradual manner. Because discarded objects were not suddenly buried, preservation is not of the same high quality. Therefore a comparison of the two sites and a determination of systematic differences can give scientists insights into the nature of abandonment and post abandonment changes which pattern materials recovered through excavation. Likely material recovered from buried trash deposits will be similar. Assuming such to be the case, the differences in remains associated with house floors and surrounding surface areas will be particularly instructive. Although research has been conducted at Ceren for many years, much less is known about San Andres. Mr. McKee will conduct systematic excavations at this latter site. A surface survey will be followed by a testing program and analysis of recovered artifacts. In addition to providing insight into preservation and abandonment processes, the data will allow for a comparison between rural hinterland and political center. The information will be of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Study of an Ancient Maya Bajo Community in Northwestern Belize,ARCHAEOLOGY,1998-06-01,T. Patrick Culbert,2001-05-31,T. Patrick Culbert,"Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Culbert MS Julie Kunen will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Building on one season of preliminary fieldwork, she will continue survey and excavation at the archaeological site of La Milpa. Located in northwestern Belize this large lowland Mayan settlement contains a range of structures which vary in size from small household size mounds to major monumental structures. Most interesting perhaps is the presence of a system of reservoirs and drainages that regulated the storage and release of water to different areas of the site. This suggests a high degree of centralized water management and control. Also associated with the site are low-lying swampy areas known as `bajos.` These features have been the focus of much speculation because many researchers believe that these areas were significantly altered by purposeful human modification and served as highly productive field systems. They believe that bajo agriculture allowed Mayan peoples to achieve population densities unusual in lowland tropical settings. MS Kunen will conduct extensive excavation in one bajo to search for cultural modifications. She will prepare a detailed vegetation map since evidence indicates that fine grained variation in vegetation patterns provides indications of human manipulation of soil. During her preliminary work MS Kunen located a number of sites located near the edge of the bajo and she will survey and excavate them. She wants to understand the social organization of the prehistoric La Milpa inhabitants and wishes to test the idea that variation in household size and status is determined by their relative placement on the landscape in relation to agricultural resources. Because her work is part of a larger project, she will be able to compare the settlements she excavates to those located in non-bajo areas. This research is important for several reasons. It will shed light on how the prehistoric Maya with a relatively simple technology were able to achieve high population densities in a resource poor environment. It may provide new insight into the principles of Mayan social organization and will assist in training a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Maya Wetlands Project: Ecology and Subsistence in Prehispanic Belize,ARCHAEOLOGY,1993-12-01,T. Patrick Culbert,1996-11-30,T. Patrick Culbert,"9318930 Culbert Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Culbert, Mr. Jeffrey Baker will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct geoarchaeological research in lowland Belize. Mr. Baker wishes to reconstruct agricultural practices of prehistoric Mayan peoples. In particular he wants to understand cultivation techniques which were practiced in lowland areas or ""bajos"" which are waterlogged for portions of the year. He will employ both geological and ecological techniques to study the nature of bajo soils, their chemistry and their water retention characteristics. He will study the vegetation of a number of bajo types to understand the relationship between soil, water and vegetation. Finally he will also conduct archaeological excavation to determine whether fields underwent human modification and how Mayan peoples used them. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that ancient Mayan peoples were able to farm low-lying tropical areas and produce enough food to support large populations. While many archaeologists believe that this was accomplished through a system of raised fields and that landscape was extensively modified, others disagree. Unfortunately the basic geological and ecological data necessary to address this question does not exist. The research which Mr. Baker will conduct should help to remedy this problem. This project is important for several reasons. Ancient Mayan peoples thrived in regions which today support only small populations. Prehistoric peoples had developed agricultural techniques which, if reconstructed could have direct practical benefit. The project will also further the development of an extremely promising young scientist. ***"
Domestic and Political Lives of the Classic Maya Elites: Subvention for the Aguateca Monographs,ARCHAEOLOGY,2009-02-01,Takeshi Inomata,2010-01-31,Daniela Triadan,"With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Takeshi Inomata and Daniel Triadan will publish the results of archaeological investigations conducted during the first phase of the Aguateca Archaeological Project from 1996 through 2003. Extensive excavations in an elite residential area and the royal palace at the Classic Maya site of Aguateca, located in the western Peten, Guatemala, uncovered a rare case of rapid abandonment around AD 810. In situ artifact assemblages which resulted from this abandonment are unprecedented in the Maya lowlands. These remains present vivid images of Classic Maya life. To disseminate these important data, Inomata and Triadan will compile a three-volume monograph series to be published from the University of Utah Press. A subvention from the NSF will specifically support the publication of Volumes 1 and 3. (Volume 2, reporting the results of the lithic analyses by Dr. Kazuo Aoyama, has received a subvention from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science).<br/><br/>Investigations during the first phase of the Aguateca Project have provided new insights into elite household organization, gender roles, power relations, Classic Maya court organization, craft production, rituals, royal symbolism, and warfare. Although project members have published these findings in numerous journal articles and book chapters, they report only a small fraction of the primary data. It is critical to make these rich data available to the scholarly community and to the general public. A detailed, well-illustrated publication of the Aguateca data will serve scholars as a basis of diverse lines of research for decades to come. <br/><br/>Print media is more adequate than digital formats for the publication of the rich contextual and cultural information that the Aguateca data present. In addition, printed books will assure that these important data will be accessible for a long term. However, many presses are now reluctant to publish data-heavy reports because of high production costs. The grant from the NSF will allow the publication of Aguateca materials in ideal print forms. Given the large amount of funds that were invested in the Aguateca Project by the NSF and other granting agencies, the relatively small amount necessary for the publication of the results is a particularly effective use of NSF funds. <br/><br/>On a larger scale, the rich information on daily life and courtly activities in Classic Maya society presented by this publication will provide a valuable resource for undergraduate and graduate education and for outreach to the public. The final publication of the project results will also ensure that this invaluable cultural heritage of the region will be passed on to future generations."
"Agency and Practice in the Classic Maya Collapse: Excavations of the Terminal Classic Royal Palace at Seibal, Guatemala",ARCHAEOLOGY,2008-04-01,Takeshi Inomata,2010-12-31,Daniela Triadan,"Drs. Takeshi Inomata and Daniela Triadan, with an international team of collaborators, will conduct a three year project at the Maya center of Seibal, Guatemala, to examine processes of political disintegration around the 9th century AD, often called the Classic Maya collapse. By extensively excavating the Terminal Classic palace remains at this site, the researchers will focus on actions and strategies of the royal elite during this social change.<br/><br/> Harvard University extensively investigated Seibal in the 1960s, documenting its unique florescence during the 9th century while many other centers were declining. Since then, Seibal has been considered a key site in the study of the Classic Maya collapse. Subsequent developments in archeological research in the region and in epigraphic decipherment have added substantial data, making the reexamination of this important center highly desirable. A critical piece of information still missing from Seibal is the royal residential complex of the Terminal Classic. Recent investigations have shown that the East Court of Seibal most likely served as the Terminal Classic royal palace.<br/><br/> By examining the Terminal Classic palace, the project members will examine the following questions: 1) Was the East Court newly constructed during the Terminal Classic, representing a break from the previous dynastic tradition? 2) How did the configurations of the palace, along with the patterns of interactions, change through time? 3) How were royal ideologies and symbolisms expressed through architectural decorations? 4) How is the decline of the Seibal dynasty reflected in the palace remains? Through a combination of extensive excavations, deep trenches, and tunnels, they will examine the presence of an earlier palace complex, changes in spatial configurations, types of activities reflected in artefactual deposits, stucco sculptures and other architectural decorations, and the process of abandonment.<br/><br/> The project promises to provide new insights into how the ruling elite tried to cope with the changing social and natural environments, either by devising new forms of political interactions and new ideologies or by maintaining old traditions. The research will also shed light on how these efforts ultimately failed. The results of the project will contribute to the understanding of the social dynamics of Classic Maya political disintegration and the anthropological study of social change.<br/><br/> The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, as well as Guatemalan students, offering them opportunities for training and research. Moreover, the project members will continue their collaboration with local communities in the region for cultural and natural conservation, which they have been developing since the 1990s. The archaeological remains of Seibal have been under serious threat since illegal occupants began deforesting a substantial part of the protected national park in the late 1990s. The proposed project will aid and promote local awareness and initiative, which are indispensable for the successful protection of the Seibal park."
"Households and Polities in Classic Maya Society: Survey and Excavation in the Aguateca Area, Guatemala",ARCHAEOLOGY,2004-06-01,Takeshi Inomata,2007-05-31,Daniela Triadan,"With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Takeshi Inomata, Daniela Triadan, and an international team of colleagues, will conduct the second phase of the Aguateca Archaeological Project, examining households in Classic Maya society (A.D. 250-900). Its first phase focused on the epicenter of Aguateca, which was abandoned rapidly because of an attack by enemies around A.D. 810. Extensive excavations of residences with numerous in situ assemblages provided extraordinary data on elite households. Investigations showed that Aguateca was originally part of the Tamarindito polity during the Tepeu I phase (A.D. 600-700) of the Late Classic period. After an intrusive dynasty, coming from Tikal, established its seats of power at Dos Pilas and Aguateca, the population of Aguateca grew explosively during the Tepeu II phase (A.D. 700-810). Households associated with the Tamarindito polity and those affiliated with the Dos Pilas/Aguateca dynasty appear to have built their houses in different architectural styles. <br/><br/>Building on the success of the first phase, the proposed second phase will examine the relationship between households and polities. The primary research questions are: How do governmental institutions of polities affect the daily lives of households and how does the organization and activities of households condition the governing strategies and political options? An effective archaeological approach for this purpose is to examine differences and similarities among households across neighboring polities with particular attention to the nature of political boundaries. The research will be guided by three theoretical concerns. The first is a debate among Maya scholars on whether Classic Maya polities had clearly demarcated boundaries or fluid, indeterminate ones. The second is that the effects of political control by the central authorities may have varied among households of different social positions. The third is that the study of this issue requires attention to multiple dimensions of society, including political administration, economic transactions, social interactions, and community identities. <br/><br/>A consideration of the specific historical context and the nature of available data leads to the following more specific questions: (1) Do the two different architectural styles exhibit clearly demarcated spatial distributions between Aguateca and the neighboring centers?; (2) Did elite and non-elite households in the Aguateca polity and the Tamarindito polity use their domestic spaces differently and conduct different types of activities?; and (3) Did elite and non-elite households in the Aguateca and Tamarindito polities have differential access to economic goods? These questions will be addressed through an integrated program of survey along transects between these centers, excavation, soil residue analyses, and continuous laboratory analyses.<br/><br/>Detailed, contextualized data obtained from the project will contribute to the growing field of household archaeology in the Maya area. They will also present theoretical implications beyond Maya archaeology, by providing a rich account of how households experienced centralized power and how the reactions of households shaped the political strategies of polities. In addition, the project will promote intellectual exchanges among scholars and students from various countries and offer opportunities for master, Ph.D., and licenciatura research. Moreover, the project will aid the preservation of cultural and natural patrimony through a sustainable development of the region and the involvement of local communities. The project will continue a long-term collaboration with the local Q'eqchi' Maya by promoting and assisting their initiatives for archaeo-eco tourism, reforestation, and lake-rejuvenation."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award: The Role Of Ritual In Household And Societal Solidarity,DDRI Archaeology,2015-03-15,Takeshi Inomata,2016-02-29,Jessica MacLellan,"Jessica MacLellan, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona, will investigate the role of household rituals in the development of ancient Maya civilization. This project will provide empirical evidence to address broad questions about the roles of households and ritual in social and political change around the world, particularly in non-Western societies. Many scholars have shown that public rituals are key to the integration of communities and the emergence of kingship in early states. Some argue that such rituals are based on pre-existing domestic practices, but in the case of the earliest Maya communities, the nature of the relationship between domestic and public remains unclear. MacLellan's research will illuminate the social processes involved in the transition to a sedentary, agriculture-based lifestyle and in the subsequent emergence of a complex civilization. Related studies in the Maya area have focused on smaller sites, later time periods, and other regions, and therefore on different social processes. MacLellan's work will provide a new, complementary perspective on the role of household activities in the development of socio-political hierarchies. <br/><br/>MacLellan's research is part of the Ceibal-Petexbatìn Archaeological Project, an international collaboration directed by Dr. Takeshi Inomata and Dr. Daniela Triadan, also of the University of Arizona. The site of Ceibal, in Guatemala, was founded as a public ceremonial center surprisingly early - around the time sedentary villages and ceramics began to appear in the Maya lowlands (about 1000 BC). Ceibal therefore presents a rare opportunity to investigate how changes in ritual practices relate to important socio-political transformations, beginning around the transition to agriculture. MacLellan has conducted preliminary investigations at the Karinel Group, an early residential area. Through further, carefully targeted excavations at the Karinel Group and subsequent laboratory analyses, MacLellan will evaluate three specific questions in order to determine how shifts in household ritual affected the broader society at Ceibal: 1) When did people at Ceibal began living in permanent, formal groups of structures, and did a more mobile lifestyle continue after the site's public plaza was constructed?; 2) During which time periods did domestic rituals resemble public rituals conducted in the Central Plaza?; and 3) Did domestic rituals involving the bones of ancestors predate and facilitate the development of socio-political hierarchies? MacLellan will establish a clear, refined chronology of the Karinel Group through ceramic analysis and radiocarbon dating in order to answer these questions. This chronology will serve as important comparative data for other Mesoamerican archaeologists. The Ceibal project will employ many local Maya and Hispanic laborers. Through interactions with nearby communities, the researchers will discourage looting, deforestation, and other destructive activities at archaeological sites in the region. The project will also train several Guatemalan students in field and laboratory methods, thereby shaping and supporting the next generation of Guatemalan archaeologists."
"Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant: Building on the Past: The Emergence of Maya Elites and Monumental Architecture at Anonal, Peten, Guatemala",ARCHAEOLOGY,2009-02-01,Takeshi Inomata,2011-07-31,Jessica Munson,"Under the supervision of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Jessica Munson will direct archaeological excavations at the ancient Maya site of Anonal located in the Department of Pet_n, Guatemala. This research examines the ways in which monumental buildings mediated the emergence and negotiation of political authority at Anonal from the Middle Preclassic through the end of the Classic period (ca. 900 B.C. - A.D. 900).<br/><br/>Archaeological excavations at Anonal will investigate the architectural history of this site to understand the emerging role of Maya elites and commemoration practices within this community. Maya temples, such as the temple complex at Anonal, commonly represent the result of multiple construction episodes and incorporate architectural elements that date back to much earlier times. Such long construction histories imply some connection with a known past. Long-term use and renovation of Anonal's temple building provides an excellent context to examine the origins of monumental construction in Maya society, as well as related changes in political organization beginning in the Preclassic period. Through intensive excavation this research will document detailed architectural histories, and analyze patterns of use, reconstruction, and abandonment at Anonal's temple complex. Excavations will focus on monumental buildings in order to examine the duration, intensity, and methods of construction associated with these structures over long periods of time. Micromorphological and radiocarbon data from intensive stratigraphic excavations will make unique contributions towards understanding the frequency of construction, the use of different construction materials and techniques, as well as the chronological sequence of these building episodes. <br/><br/>Built environments reflect particular forms of social organization and actively shape people's perception of their surroundings by contributing a sense of place to the people that use them. Alterations to these social landscapes concomitantly affect the creation and transformation of social memories, as well as signify changes in social and political order. Archaeological research on the cultural construction of monumental architecture suggests that these buildings mediated the organization and negotiation of political power and commemoration in ancient Maya society. Legitimization strategies by elite leaders often invoke the past as a means to establish ancestral connections and assert political authority. By examining the construction history and use of Anonal's temple complex, this research will contribute understanding to the origins of Maya monumental architecture and associated changes in political organization. <br/><br/>This research project also has immediate impacts for cultural patrimony regarding the conservation of endangered sites and heritage education. Excavation of Anonal's temple complex will promote stabilization and conservation of threatened structures for future generations. This project will also establish collaborative partnerships with Guatemalan archaeology students and local Qeqchi Maya communities engaged in sustainable cultural tourism projects. Students will be trained in archaeological field methods and participate in laboratory analyses. Local Qeqchi Maya people will also participate in the excavation program and learn about their cultural landscape. This knowledge will promote stewardship of archaeological resources directed by indigenous communities."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Spatial Formation of a Complex Middle American Society,ARCHAEOLOGY,2011-03-15,Takeshi Inomata,2012-02-29,Kenichiro Tsukamoto,"Under the supervision of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Kenichiro Tsukamoto will examine the spatial formation of a peripheral architectural group at the Maya site of El Palmar, Mexico. This regional center is situated at the intersection of three competing political spheres, Tikal, Calakmul, and RÍo Bec (A.D. 400-800). With only traditional technologies and neither wheeled vehicles or domestic animals the Mayans were able to construct complex societies in an inhospitable lowland environment. Social scientists wish to understand how such systems functioned and what links served to bind large numbers of individuals together. Many traditional societies exist in the world today and knowledge gained about the past is relevant in a contemporary context.<br/><br/>El Palmar is located in southeastern Campeche, Mexico and it consists of the civic-ceremonial core or the Main Group and seven peripheral architectural groups surrounding the Main Group. The proposed research specifically focuses on the Guzmˆn Group, one of these peripheral groups located 1.3 km north of the Main Group. The previous survey identified a hieroglyphic stairway adjoined to a small pyramidal temple along with six other structures around a plaza in this group. <br/><br/>This research will assess the evidence for the social status of residents at the Guzmˆn Group and their political and ideological relationships with ruling elites at the Main Group. Specifically, this study evaluates five alternative hypotheses: the Guzmˆn Group was inhabited by 1) sub-royal or higher elites; 2) intermediate or lower-status individuals; 3) commoners with a temple sponsored by El Palmar rulers; 4) no residents; the group was a purely ritual place representing the northern part of the cardinal worldview, and 5) people resided after the collapse of the El Palmar polity. These hypotheses will be tested through extensive excavations, surface survey, and laboratory analyses. The excavations of the plaza and six structures around it are designed to uncover inscriptions of a hieroglyphic stairway, construction materials of all the buildings, and their associated artifacts. Surface survey will examine the presence of a causeway that connects both groups, which will serve to assess whether the Guzmˆn Group was symbolically connected to the core area. The analysis of artifacts will focus on the quantity and distribution of prestige and exotic materials. The results will be compared with data from the Main Group to discern the nature of power and ideological relations between both groups. <br/><br/>Hieroglyphic stairways were usually constructed at the civic-ceremonial core to legitimize the political power of ruling elites, and the case of El Palmar stands as exceptional to this general tendency. A detailed examination of the social processes resulting in the construction of a hieroglyphic stairway in a peripheral area may reveal the dynamic nature of power struggles and ideological negotiations in Classic Maya society. Furthermore, this study will highlight the relationship between the formation of center-periphery relations within a polity and changing broader geopolitical relations among neighboring regional centers during the period of political upheavals (A.D. 400-900). New evidence about the social group and their practices at a peripheral architectural group will broaden our current knowledge on varying strategies of rulers and other social groups in response to external political dynamics. <br/><br/>This research will provide important collaborations among U.S., Mexican, and Japanese students and academic professionals. The substantial results from this project will be disseminated broadly through publications and presentations at scholarly conferences as well as through public outreach in U.S., Mexico, and Japan. The recovered materials and information will be available for other researchers and students at the laboratory of the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH) in Mexico City."
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award: Community Organization And Sport Relationships,DDRI Archaeology,2015-04-01,Takeshi Inomata,2016-03-31,Marijke Stoll,"Under the supervision of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Marijke Stoll will explore the intersections between formalized competitive interaction, sociopolitical conflict, and public architecture among Prehispanic societies in southeastern Mexico. Such interaction through for example sporting events can serve valuable social functions which extend well beyond viewer entertainment. They provide a forum to consolidate and strengthen cultural affiliation and integrate broad and often diverse groups of individuals within a regional or national framework. Such regional based competition was integral to community and regional politics among ancient societies. Archaeology as a discipline is well-placed to investigate the social role of sports in the distant past. <br/><br/>The Prehispanic ballgame was an important ritualized sport and shared cultural tradition that was played throughout much of ancient Mexico. It was played in large masonry ballcourts, unique structures that were constructed for this single purpose. As a special category of public architecture, ballcourts would have distinguished communities from each other. How ballcourts were distributed across the social landscape was significant - where a ballcourt was emplaced within public space would express the importance of the ballgame to political and daily life. By measuring the centrality of the ballcourt and how accessible it was, it is possible to infer their sociopolitical function at the local and regional levels. <br/><br/>The research assesses the degree to which the ballgame was interwoven with local community politics in the Nejapa region of Oaxaca, Mexico. During the dynamic Postclassic (AD 1000 - 1521), a time of internal population expansion, settlement reorganization, and outside pressure from expanding imperial armies, several communities in Nejapa constructed multiple ballcourts. This suggests that residents of Nejapa may have used the ballgame to integrate different social strata, highlight social differences, and resolve or heighten intra- and intercommunity conflicts. The research will test the hypothesis that the ballgame was a key tool used by both local elites and different communities in Nejapa through site reconnaissance, topographical mapping, and geospatial analysis of ballcourt placement and distribution. Specifically, the project focuses on two broad questions. First, how central was the ballcourt to community social organization and who would have been the intended audience for ballgames and other ritual activities performed in and around the court? Second, does the distribution of ballcourts overlap with the distribution of complex civic centers in Nejapa? Systematic study of the ballcourts in Nejapa at the local and regional scales enhances understanding of how a competitive sport became an important sociopolitical institution in Mesoamerica. <br/><br/>As the first in-depth study of the ballcourts in Nejapa, this project will be conducted in collaboration with area communities with the goal of documenting, recording and preserving the local cultural heritage for future generations to come. Study results will be disseminated through publications and presentations at scholarly venues, official reports for the Mexican government, and a project website targeted at broader audiences. Data from Nejapa will be added to a much larger geodatabase on ballcourts in Oaxaca that will improve the availability of information as well as permit further statistical and geospatial analyses for future research."
"Classic Maya Elite Households: The Analysis of Floor Assemblages from Burned Sructures at Aguateca, Guatemala",ARCHAEOLOGY,2000-06-15,Takeshi Inomata,2004-05-31,Takeshi Inomata,"With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Takeshi Inomata will conduct three seasons of analysis of archaeological material recovered from the site of Aguateca. Located in the Petexbatum region of Guatemala, this large multiroom site includes an extensive and complex system of defensive walls. Its epicenter contains a main plaza, causeway and a ""palace group"" which was the possible residence of a royal family. Surrounding this are elite residential areas. Dr. Inomata has conducted three seasons of excavation at the site and this indicates that the elite area was burned during an attack by enemies during the Late Classic period, ca. 800 A.D. The residents fled leaving most of their belongings behind and these have proven to be the richest floor assemblages ever found at a lowland Classic Maya site. Aguateca therefore offers a unique opportunity since at most sites, room materials which archaeologists recover represent worn-out and abandoned artifacts which provide only the most limited and biased insights into prehistoric lives. Dr. Inomata and a team of collaborators will now analyze the materials recovered. Because most pottery was smashed, significant effort will involved reconstruction. These objects, as well as many fragments, will be drawn and photographed. Use-wear analysis of stone tools will provide important information about the activities conducted the residents. The team will analyze the spatial distribution of various types of materials to examine activity areas and household organization. Soils will be analyzed to search for chemical signatures of specific cultural activities.<br/><br/>Both archaeologists and cultural anthropologists have come, in recent years, to realize that in traditional societies households are the basic units of subsistence and production and to understand how groups such as the Maya functioned it is necessary to reconstruct activities on a household level. It is through comparison of individual well documented household groups that insight into social hierarchies and economic and political organization can best be understood. Dr. Inomata and his colleagues wish to understand how Classic period Maya households were organized. They will determine what kind of activities were conducted in and around dwellings and how individual households articulated with higher-level political, economic and social organizations.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. Because of the extraordinary nature of the site, it will provide a unique insight into Maya life and produce data of interest to many archaeologists. It should also shed new light on how with a relatively simple technology and in harsh environmental conditions the Mayan civilization arose and was maintained."
"Dissertation Research: Social Emplacement on an Early Maya Landscape: Assessing Preclassic Duration at Aguateca and Punta de Chimino, Guatemala",ARCHAEOLOGY,2004-02-01,Takeshi Inomata,2006-01-31,Takeshi Inomata,"Under the supervision of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Bruce Bachand will excavate Late Preclassic cultural remains at the neighboring Maya centers of Aguateca and Punta de Chimino in Guatemala's Petexbatun region. Preliminary excavations indicate these centers were occupied during an unstable political period in ancient Maya culture history from 100 B.C. to A.D. 350. Both communities erected small pyramids at this time in an effort to anchor their social identities and political dispositions in a place. Bachand's excavations will refine the chronology at these two centers using radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dates retrieved from burials, cache deposits, middens, and plaster surfaces in an effort to trace a sequence of modifications to public spaces, monumental buildings, and surrounding residences. <br/><br/>In agrarian cultures like the Maya, a community's social identity, its connection to forbearers, and its collective memory become materially fused in physical places. A number of practices characterize Preclassic Maya social emplacement-burial of the dead, expansion of residential buildings, maintenance and refurbishment of public spaces, and the deposition of ritual objects in public spaces. The frequency, duration, and social nature of these practices are indicative of a Maya community's rootedness or attachment to a place at various moments in time. This study aims to correlate the local expression of these practices with evidence of political change in adjacent areas within the Maya region.<br/><br/>This project has multiple levels of significance for anthropology, archaeology, and the prehistory of the Maya lowlands. For anthropology, it addresses how people anchor themselves to places materially during times of broad cultural change, especially political change entailing the reinvention of leadership and reshaping of local community identities when a state disintegrates. In the archaeological sphere, the project seeks to develop more effective and accurate means of chronometric dating through the creative acquisition of samples and application of 'reality based' statistical tools. Finally, the early cultural history of the Maya region will be improved. New dates and new archaeological evidence will be used to assess how early Petexbatun communities fit into the social fabric of a rapidly changing Late Preclassic landscape.<br/><br/>Besides addressing scientific questions, Bachand's project will enhance modern people's emplacement on the Petexbatun landscape. Local Q'eqchi' Maya are developing their own archaeo-tourism businesses as large, internationally funded restoration projects approach completion at Aguateca and Dos Pilas. Q'eqchi' Maya will learn about their ancestral roots as project excavators. Bachand will also help the owner's of the local Chimino's Island Lodge develop interpretive media for visitors to Punta de Chimino. Improvements of this kind attract foreign tourists, encourage local entrepreneurship, and foster appreciation for the region's cultural patrimony."
Formal Models Of Traditional Milling Tool Design,ARCHAEOLOGY,2014-07-09,Tammy Buonasera,2017-07-31,Tammy Buonasera,"Archaeology, through reconstruction of past behaviors and how they emerge and adapt over time, has the potential to provide insight into processes which shape human behavior and social organization today. To accomplish this goal it is necessary to have robust analytic tools which permit researchers to move from objects excavated from the ground to conclusions regarding the behaviors of people responsible for their discard. This project is important because it assists in developing such techniques.<br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tammy Buonasera will begin a series of experiments using replicas of prehistoric ground stone milling tools (manos and metates and mortars and pestles) to generate empirically informed models of ground stone processing efficiency. These models will help evaluate relationships between ground stone technology, mobility, and resource use among prehistoric hunter-gatherers. The significance of the project rests on its potential to increase knowledge of economic decisions made by individuals engaged in plant food processing. In many contexts around the world, changes in the form and frequency of ground stone milling tools play key roles in reconstructing sequences of resource intensification, sedentism, and plant domestication. Despite this, there are few empirically grounded comparisons of the relative efficiency of different milling tool-resource combinations in the literature. Rather, links between form and function typically rest on commonsense notions of efficiency or ""suitability."" This study will provide better estimates than we now have for defining when it would be profitable to shift between grinding technologies, and results will be widely applicable to studies of ground stone function and resource use in many places and times. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed project will begin with a series of controlled experiments designed to measure and compare the efficiency of five different forms (three mortar and two metate shapes), and two different raw materials (a harder and a softer stone), for processing four resources with different physical characteristics (acorns, small hard seeds, tule roots, and ocher). Because this research aims to provide data for modeling tool design choices among hunters and gatherers with varying degrees of mobility (i.e., from conditions of high residential mobility, where food is not stored, to semi-sedentary contexts, where food storage may be critical), experiments will also compare grinding efficiency and use-wear patterns for fresh and dried versions of the plant resources (acorns, small hard seeds, tule roots). Simple optimization models will be used to compare experimental estimates of food processing labor and costs of tool manufacture against overall productivity. Ultimately, this research will improve knowledge about relationships between grinding tool designs and economic decisions made by individuals engaged in food processing. It will also contribute to improving interpretations of use-wear patterns on ground stone tools. The project will be completed over a two-year period with the help of community volunteers and university students who will participate in the experimental process. The project will also produce both a physical and a digital reference set for future use-wear analysis."
"SGER: Genetic, Linguistic Diversity of the Highland Populations of Daghestan","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Biological Anthropology",2007-09-15,Tatiana Karafet,2008-08-31,Tatiana Karafet,"A longstanding question in human genetic research is the mysterious origins of the populations of Dagestan in the northern Caucasus Mountains. Living in isolation for millennia, the more than 30 ethnic groups in this region contain a reservoir of cultural, linguistic and genetic diversity that represents an invaluable and untapped resource for understanding the origin of Eurasian peoples and the processes that shaped the early European genetic landscape. Studies of these populations have been hindered, in great part, because access to the northern Caucasus has been difficult for western researchers. Preliminary ground breaking research of a few of the many indigenous populations of highland Daghestan by a native researcher, Dr. Kazima Bulaeva from the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, provided a first glimpse into the unique genetic and cultural heritage of this region. The extreme pattern of variability that she found at such a small geographic scale is reflected in the highly divergent language phyla spoken in the region, with the languages of Nakh-Daghestan (North East Caucasian) estimated to have been diverging from those of Northwest Caucasian for at least five thousand years. The purpose of this project is to expand on these preliminary studies by collecting genetic and demographic data, as well as a Swadesh word list, from several key, remote highland villages in the Northern Caucasus. This interdisciplinary project is a collaborative venture between the University of Arizona and Russian geneticists and linguists working with Dr. Bulayeva, who will retire from the Vavilov Institute in the coming year. Dr. Bulayeva has unique access to Daghestan because she grew up there and belongs to the Lak ethnic group. In view of the war in neighboring Chechnya and increasing emigration from small isolated highland villages to large lowland cities, there is a vanishing window of opportunity to carry out this work. The ensuing population instability is threatening the catastrophic loss of this genetic and cultural heritage of unique scientific value. Because of the political situation, very few scientists other than Dr. Bulayeva are able to travel in the highlands and collect these data. A subsequent proposal will be submitted to analyze the resulting database of genetic, demographic, kinship and linguistic data."
"Dissertation Research: Ethnicity, State Intervention and Agricultural Intensification in the Ziz Valley, Morocco",CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,1994-03-01,Thomas Park,1996-08-31,Thomas Park,"LBP:\A9321194 Park This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Arizona, studying the impact of ethnicity and state intervention on small-scale, intensive irrigated agriculture in Morocco. Using a combination of archival and ethnographic research, the student will study two villages, one with a sure source of irrigation water from a water control project, and one with the traditional insecure sources of water. The student will interview members of the three dominant ethnic groups in these villages to investigate how social class, ethnicity, and access to development programs interact to affect the productivity of small-holder farming. This research is important because traditional farmers in many parts of the world are involved with state irrigation programs. Increased understanding of local cases such as this one, of how ethnic differences and social-economic class position within the village affect the farmers' ability to take advantage of state- sponsored programs, and whether these programs actually increase productivity, will provide valuable information to economic development planners. ***"
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant: Paleoenvironmental Context of Ancestral Puebloan Demographic and Subsistence Change in West-Central New Mexico,ARCHAEOLOGY,2010-09-01,Vance Holliday,2013-05-31,Jill Onken,"Under the direction of Dr. Vance T. Holliday, Jill Onken will investigate the relationship between environmental change and shifting patterns in prehistoric human land use and in the Carrizo Wash watershed in west-central New Mexico. The initial adoption of maize agriculture (2100 B.C.), the Chaco Phenomenon (A.D. 1050-1130), and regional depopulation (A.D. 1300-1350) are among the most significant episodes in Ancestral Puebloan prehistory in the American Southwest. Current perspectives on the cultural processes and circumstances associated with these key prehistoric events, however, are limited by an incomplete understanding of past environmental conditions. Knowing the nature and degree of any environmental changes associated with these major subsistence and demographic changes is essential for refining archaeological interpretations and explanations at both local and regional scales. <br/><br/>This geoarchaeological dissertation study will entail documentation of numerous stratigraphic sections. An extensive radiocarbon dating effort will permit the development of a detailed depositional and landscape history for this watershed that will be integrated with existing climatic and archaeological data. Analysis of sediment, soil, pollen, phytolith, carbon isotope, and tree ring records will contribute to the reconstruction of a wide range of environmental variables, including geomorphic, soil, and climatic factors that affected the viability of prehistoric maize agriculture. A geographic information system (GIS) will be used to integrate the archaeological and environmental data and to examine the relations among changing land use, environment, and agricultural potential over time and space.<br/><br/>The Carrizo Wash watershed is well suited for this study because of its long history of archaeological research, the presence of one of the oldest known early agriculture sites in the Southwest, an abundance of alluvial exposures in modern arroyo walls with local concentrations of datable materials, and proximity to localities with long, well-studied tree-ring records. Broad similarities among Holocene alluvial records across the Southwest suggest that the Carrizo Wash environmental reconstruction will have regional relevance.<br/><br/>The results of the proposed interdisciplinary study will be useful to archaeologists interested in the many influences of environmental change on prehistoric cultural change and human adaptation in the Southwest, as well as in semiarid regions in general. The findings will be equally significant to Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists interested in how hillslopes and streams respond to climate change in semiarid regions. Because land productivity for range, farming, and wildlife habitat is severely compromised by widespread erosion, this study will also be relevant to land managers, especially in light of modern climate change. This study will provide graduate student training, as well as learning opportunities for undergraduate students belonging to minority groups underrepresented in the geosciences through the Southern Arizona Geosciences Union for Academics, Research, and Outreach (SAGUARO) program funded by NSF. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community through publication in refereed journals and presentations at professional conferences and to the public through public interest stories, presentations in K-12 classrooms, and/or posters placed in public buildings in communities near the study area."
Instrumentation for Experimental Economics Laboratory,ARCHAEOLOGY,1996-09-01,Vernon Smith,1997-08-31,Vernon Smith,"With National Science Foundation support Dr. Vernon Smith will purchase 20 90 mHz Pentium `IBM type compatible` micro computers, 27 16 MB RAM upgrades for existing machines and a portable high resolution projection system to upgrade and expand the University of Arizona Economic Science Laboratory. Dr Smith is a leader in experimental economics and he and his collaborators have worked to develop experimental situations in which human subjects make choices which have real potential economic rewards. Computerization has made it feasible to design various real time market institutions, to study their performance in the laboratory and thus gain insight into how markets function and how humans respond. Beginning about a decade ago laboratory experiments started to explore the performance of `smart` computer assisted markets. In these experimental markets the messages (bids) of decentralized agents are processed using various optimization algorithms applied to batches of bids or to bids arriving in real time. This has greatly expanded the demands on hardware capacity and software sophistication. As these experimental markets have become technologically more complex, and demanding of system design and support, they have also become more demanding on the ability of human subjects to articulate rational message responded based on judgment and calculation. Consequently the next generation of experimental markets will require `expert system` computer support at each station for the decision maker(s) at that station. The computers provided in this award will make such an advance possible. In addition to increasing understanding of principles which underlie human economic behavior, experimental economics serves a number of practical functions. It helps regulators and government officials to design systems to allocate scarce resources such as radio wave space or airline gates and to design effective bidding processes. At Arizona the programs developed will also be incorporated into the teaching of economics on both a local and worldwide basis."
"Doctoral Research: Patterns in Metal Selection and Processing in Middle Sican Copper Technology, AD 900-1100: Multi-Dimensional Analysis",ARCHAEOLOGY,1999-05-15,W. David Kingery,2001-10-31,W. David Kingery,"Under the direction of Dr David Kingery, MS Aniko Bezur will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will sample and analyze a series of copper artifacts which were manufactured during the Middle Sican period (900-1100 AD) on the northern coast of Peru. For a number of years an archaeological research project under the direction of Dr. Izumi Shimada has traced the rise and subsequent decline of the Sican state and has excavated large numbers of copper objects such as needles, tweezers and metal bells. Sican peoples mastered and refined the art of copper working and the project has uncovered remains of smelters and byproducts associated with this process. Through experimentation much of the manufacturing procedure has been reconstructed and MS Bezur will augment this work through the compositional analysis of finished products. Samples will be mounted in epoxy, polished and then analyzed by electron microprobe to determine the average composition of the sample surface. Variation of arsenic content within the microstructure will also be determined through elemental mapping. This information, along with optical images will provide insight into how original solidification took place as well as the history of thermal treatments that the artifact underwent during production. Neutron Activation Analysis will also be conducted at the University of Missouri reactor.<br/><br/>The project has several goals. It will help to determine the degrees of sophistication and control that Sican metallurgists possessed. Prior work has indicated that addition of small amounts of arsenic to copper can increase its performance capabilities and that percentage of arsenic varies among objects. However scientists do not know whether prehistoric artisans recognized the advantages which arsenic conferred and controlled the formula accordingly or whether arsenic is incorporated as an unintentional byproduct. It is possible that amount of arsenic varied by artifact type and MS Bezur will analyze a variety of kinds of tools for this reason. Archaeologists do not know how important a role metallurgy played in ancient Peru and the extent to which it contributed to the rise of early state level organizations in the region. Studies to date have focused on artifacts recovered in tombs and other ritual contexts only and its general usage is not understood. MS Bezur's research will set this technology in a broader cultural context.<br/><br/>This project is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase understanding of the relationship between technological and social organization and assist in training a promising young scientist."
"Dissertation Research: Potters and Politics: An Ethnoarchaeological Study of Political Competition and Craft Specialization in Paradijon, Southern Luzon, Philippines",ARCHAEOLOGY,1996-11-01,William Longacre,1998-10-31,Mark Neupert,"Under the direction of Dr. William Longacre, Mr. Mark Neupert will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will obtain neutron activation and petrographic thin section analyses of ceramic materials collected during an ethnoarchaeological study in Paradijon a village in the Philippines. He will also conduct a network analysis to determine social ties among artisans who live in the village. The goal of Mr. Neupert's research is to gain insight into the relationship between social factors which structure a society and the artifacts which individuals produce. During the course of his now completed fieldwork, Mr. Neupert studied potters who produced ceramics for sale in local markets. Part of this research involved determining the sources from which individuals obtained clay and the techniques they employed to mix and prepare it. He wished to determine the range of behavioral variation which existed and how this related to other social factors such as political, economic and kinship ties. To accomplish this he collected both social data and pottery produced by a range of individuals .During his study in Paradijon, shifts fractional disputes resulted in political realignments and this had a direct effect on how potters were organized and the sources from which they obtained their raw materials. Mr. Neupert will now conduct systematic analyses of these data at both a social and material level. Archaeologists wish to reconstruct the behavior of the prehistoric societies they study and given the limited material remains which are usually recovered through excavation, this goal can be extremely difficult to achieve. Because of its durable structure, pottery is often recovered in large amounts and researchers attempt to develop analytic techniques which will yield the maximum amount of information through study of it. To understand how a potentially wide range of behaviors are indirectly reflected in such material remains it is necessary to examine controlled present day situations where both behavior and material byproduct can be directly observed. Mr. Neupert has obtained relevant information from just such a context. This research is important because it will provide a case study of interest to many archaeologists. It will help to develop analytic techniques of potentially broad archaeological value and assist in training a promising young scientist."
Dissertation Research: Use Alteration of Pottery,ARCHAEOLOGY,1989-10-15,William Longacre,1991-09-30,William Longacre,"Under the direction of Dr. William Longacre, Mr. James Skibo will conduct a series of analyses on traditional Kalinga ceramics. The results will provide the basis for his doctoral dissertation thesis. The Kalinga, traditional Philippine agriculturalists, are one of an ever decreasing group of peoples in the world who still manufacture ceramics for their own use. For many years, Dr. Longacre and his students have recorded this process and watched how the finished products are employed in everyday activities. A large series of such vessels have been observed in use, collected, and now reside at the University of Arizona. Mr. Skibo will carry out two kinds of analysis on a sample of them. First, he will conduct an SEM study to examine surface wear and abrasion. Because detailed information on actual use is available, he should be able to match human induced cause with microscopic effect. Secondly, he will attempt to extract fatty acids, which are absorbed into the ceramic fabric during cooking, to test the feasibility of determining food contents. These acids are not heat destroyed during the cooking process. Because pottery resists degradation and has been widely used for over 10,000 years, it constitutes a major class of archaeological remains. While prehistorians have devoted great deal of attention to the stylistic analysis of ceramic materials, satisfactory techniques do not exist to determine actual uses. Mr. Skibo's research will, hopefully, serve to develop several which will be general enough to allow application in a wide variety of circumstances. Because so much information is available for the Kalinga materials, they provide an excellent controlled situation for such a technique development project."
"Dissertation: Midden Formation and Post-Depostional Alteration of Ceramics in Kalinga, Philipines","HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION, ARCHAEOLOGY",2000-09-01,William Longacre,2003-02-28,William Longacre,"Under the direction of Dr. William Longacre MS Margaret Beck will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will examine ceramic use, discard and post-discard alteration of pottery manufactured by Kalinga speaking peoples of northern Luzon, Philippines. The groups in this region live in villages of 50-90 households and support themselves largely irrigated rice farming. Two such villages continue to produce ceramic vessels for cooking, drinking water and food storage despite the increasing availability and popularity of metal and plastic containers. Thus they offer the opportunity to examine the use of an artifact class which has been employed by humans for over 10,000 years and which constitutes an important category of material excavated from many archaeological sites. MS Beck's work builds on a series of projects conducted in the region by both Dr. Longacre and a series of prior graduate students. The primary goal of her research is to see how well-known patterns of use alteration on modern Kalinga ceramics are altered or disguised during burial within a Kalinga archaeological site. Because ceramics are altered during use, archaeologists can study such characteristics as abrasion on the inside and outside of vessels or charring in an attempt to reconstruct function. However both cultural and natural processes can affect vessels and vessel fragments, potentially altering or obscuring the evidence of use. Post-use alterations must be correctly identified before use alteration can be evaluated. While MS Beck will examine vessel use, her work will focus on the factors which affect ceramics after their discard. She will study the process of trash midden accumulation and excavate discarded ceramics of varying age. Four basic classes of ceramic modification will be studied: 1. ""Acid leaching"" or iron leaching; 2. removal of exterior and interior carbon; 3. abrasion; and 4. fragmentation and dispersion. Natural alterations of vessel fragments will be reproduced experimentally to better understand and predict the conditions under which they occur. <br/><br/>Because ceramics were widely used prehistorically and preserve well in many archaeological contexts, they constitute a significant class of artifact recovered during archaeological excavation. Some projects yield literally tons of sherds and therefore researchers wish to extract the maximum possible amount of information from them. MS Beck has recognized that post discard processes can significantly complicate and bias this process and her research will provide insights and guidelines of widespread archaeological use. The project will also assist in training a promising young scientist."
An Analysis of Kalinga Technology,ARCHAEOLOGY,1987-07-15,William Longacre,1989-12-31,William Longacre,"This grant permits Dr. Longacre to return to Northern Luzon in the Phillipines to continue research among the Kalinga people. The Kalinga are a ""traditional"" group in which both pottery and basketry is locally produced. With the help of both U.S. and Phillipino assistants Dr. Longacre will continue his work to learn how material objects are produced, used and finally discarded. In particular, he will continue to follow a population of over 2,000 pots in use and through household inventories to obtain an accurate picture of just how long pots last. He will also undertake detailed studies of the surface alteration of pottery which results from use and make a substantial collection of ""used"" pots for research and teaching. This pottery project is an outgrowth of prior NSF supported research. Dr. Longacre will also begin a basketry study which is important because while women produce pottery, baskets are made by men. Thus it will be possible to compare male.female differences in production. Although the team is working with living people, the goal of this research is archaeological. Because potsherds are well preserved they are often recovered in archaeological contexts and in many sites constitute the majority of the excavated finds. From these archaeologists must make inferences about the people who made them, and unless one knows how pottery is produced and how it functions in a society this can be extremely difficult to do. In this project the study of use wear should make it possible to infer the uses to which particular vessels were put. Through study of breakage rates it should be possible, on the basis of archaeologically recovered remains, to determine the number of total pots in the population."
Dissertation Research: The Paleo-Indian Archaeology and Stratigraphy of Offshore Florida,ARCHAEOLOGY,1991-07-01,C. Vance Haynes,1993-06-30,Michael K. Faught,"Under the guidance of Dr. C. Vance Haynes, Mr. Michael K. Faught will collect information for his doctoral dissertation. In the first stage of the research, Mr. Faught will employ a geopulse devise to map underwater features and relict river segments along the Aucilla river channel which is located in Florida's Apalachee Bay. In particular, an attempt will be made to locate underwater sinkholes. With the data thus acquired, a second phase of the work will focus on the coring of promising areas. These cores will be photographed and examined for pollen, macro botanical remains, sediment characteristics and radiocarbon samples. The ultimate objectives of the work are to find bone bed accumulations which are likely spots for Paleo-Indian remains, and to construct a sedimentary profile out from the current Aucilla River mouth onto the continental shelf. The geological data thus obtained will further aid the discovery of underwater archaeological sites. Remains of extinct animals and Paleo-indian artifacts are frequently found in the karst sinkholes of Northwestern Florida along with clear stratigraphic evidence for Holocene environmental change. These sinkholes were reliable sources of water for late Pleistocene animals, hunting sites used by prehistoric people and traps for subsequent sediment accumulations. So far, however, all these sinkholes have been disturbed by amateur diver/collectors before geoarchaeological scrutiny could take place. Sinkholes currently located offshore in this region can solve this problem because they most likely contain extinct faunal remains as well as archaeological materials. (At the end of the Pleistocene sea levels were lower than at present.) Numerous offshore archaeological sites have been located offshore in this area, but no one has yet probed the inundated relict karst river channels for their protected early archaeology. This research is important for several reasons. It will, hopefully, locate sites which can be excavated in future years by Mr. Faught as well as other archaeologists. It will increase our understanding of the native American past and assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist."
